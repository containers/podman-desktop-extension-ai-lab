# AI studio

The Podman Desktop AI Studio extension simplifies getting started and developing with AI in a local environment.  It provides key open-source technologies to start building on AI.  A curated catalog of so-called recipes helps navigate the jungle of AI use cases and AI models.  AI Studio further ships playgrounds: environments to experiment with and test AI models, for instance, a chat bot.

## Running in development mode

From the AI Studio packages/frontend folder:

```
$ yarn watch
```

If you are not live editing the frontend package, you can just run (from the AI Studio sources folder):

```
$ yarn build
```

From the Podman Desktop sources folder:

```
$ yarn watch --extension-folder path-to-extension-sources-folder/packages/backend
```

## Providing a custom catalog

The extension provides a default catalog, but you can build your own catalog by creating a file `$HOME/podman-desktop/ai-studio/catalog.json`.
 
The catalog provides lists of categories, recipes, and models.

Each recipe can belong to one or several categories. Each model can be used by one or several recipes.

The format of the catalog is not stable nor versioned yet, you can see the current catalog's format [in the sources of the extension](https://github.com/projectatomic/studio-extension/blob/main/packages/backend/src/ai.json).

## Packaging sample applications

Sample applications may be added to the catalog. See [packaging guide](PACKAGING-GUIDE.md) for detailed information.
