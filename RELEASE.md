# Release process for Podman AI Lab

## Pre-requisites

- Create Enhancement Issue `Release vX.X.X` for current sprint, then update the label to `kind/release` and assign it to yourself.
- Confirm with Podman Desktop maintainers that pending / need-to-go-in PR's have been merged.
- Notify main contributors on Discord / Slack.

In the below example, we will pretend that we're upgrading from `1.1.0` to `1.2.0`. Please use the CORRECT release numbers as these are just example numbers.

## Release timeline

Below is what a typical release week may look like:

- **Monday (Notify):** 48-hour notification. Communicate to maintainers and public channels a release will be cut on Wednesday and to merge any pending PRs. Inform QE team. Start work on blog post as it is usually the longest part of the release process.
- **Tuesday (Staging, Testing & Blog):** Stage the release (see instructions below) to create a new cut of the release to test. Test the pre-release (master branch) build briefly. Get feedback from committers (if applicable). Push the blog post for review (as it usually takes a few back-and-forth reviews on documentation).
- **Wednesday (Release):** Publish the new release on the catalog using the below release process.
- **Thursday (Post-release Testing & Blog):** Test the post-release build briefly for any critical bugs. Confirm that new release has been pushed to the catalog. Push the blog post live. Get a known issues list together from QE and publish to the Podman Desktop Discussions, link to this from the release notes.
- **Friday (Communicate):** Friday is statistically the best day for new announcements. Post on internal channels. Post on reddit, hackernews, twitter, etc.

## Test release before it is rolling out.

The release is a pre-release, it means it is not yet the latest version, so no clients will automatically update to this version.

It allows QE (and everyone else) to test the release before they it will go live on the catalog.


## Next phase

- ‚ùå All severe bugs and regressions are investigated and discussed. If we agree any should block the release, need to fix the bugs and do a respin of the release with a new .z release like 1.2.1 instead of 1.2.0.

Create a branch if it does not exist. For example 1.2.x if 1.2.0 failed. Then, cherry-pick bugfixes in that branch.

- ‚úÖ If committers agree we have a green light, proceed. **Do not forget to change the release from 'pre-release' to 'latest release' before proceeding**.

## Updating catalog

Pre-requisites:

- Ensure the release is OK (green workflow, image has been published https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-ai-lab/releases https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-ai-lab/pkgs/container/podman-desktop-extension-ai-lab).

#### Catalog

Create and submit a PR to the catalog (https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-catalog on branch gh-pages). This is manual and will be automated in the future.
