      "readme": "# Chat Application\n\n  This recipe helps developers start building their own custom LLM enabled chat applications. It consists of two main components: the Model Service and the AI Application.\n\n  There are a few options today for local Model Serving, but this recipe will use [`llama-cpp-python`](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) and their OpenAI compatible Model Service. There is a Containerfile provided that can be used to build this Model Service within the repo, [`model_servers/llamacpp_python/base/Containerfile`](/model_servers/llamacpp_python/base/Containerfile).\n\n  The AI Application will connect to the Model Service via its OpenAI compatible API. The recipe relies on [Langchain's](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) python package to simplify communication with the Model Service and uses [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the UI layer. You can find an example of the chat application below.\n\n![](/assets/chatbot_ui.png) \n\n\n## Try the Chat Application\n\nThe [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io) [AI Lab Extension](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-ai-lab) includes this recipe among others. To try it out, open `Recipes Catalog` -> `Chatbot` and follow the instructions to start the application.\n\n# Build the Application\n\nThe rest of this document will explain how to build and run the application from the terminal, and will\ngo into greater detail on how each container in the Pod above is built, run, and \nwhat purpose it serves in the overall application. All the recipes use a central [Makefile](../../common/Makefile.common) that includes variables populated with default values to simplify getting started. Please review the [Makefile docs](../../common/README.md), to learn about further customizing your application.\n\n\nThis application requires a model, a model service and an AI inferencing application.\n\n* [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n* [Download a model](#download-a-model)\n* [Build the Model Service](#build-the-model-service)\n* [Deploy the Model Service](#deploy-the-model-service)\n* [Build the AI Application](#build-the-ai-application)\n* [Deploy the AI Application](#deploy-the-ai-application)\n* [Interact with the AI Application](#interact-with-the-ai-application)\n* [Embed the AI Application in a Bootable Container Image](#embed-the-ai-application-in-a-bootable-container-image)\n\n\n## Quickstart\nTo run the application with pre-built images from `quay.io/ai-lab`, use `make quadlet`. This command\nbuilds the application's metadata and generates Kubernetes YAML at `./build/chatbot.yaml` to spin up a Pod that can then be launched locally.\nTry it with:\n\n```\nmake quadlet\npodman kube play build/chatbot.yaml\n```\n\nThis will take a few minutes if the model and model-server container images need to be downloaded. \nThe Pod is named `chatbot`, so you may use [Podman](https://podman.io) to manage the Pod and its containers:\n\n```\npodman pod list\npodman ps\n```\n\nOnce the Pod and its containers are running, the application can be accessed at `http://localhost:8501`. \nPlease refer to the section below for more details about [interacting with the chatbot application](#interact-with-the-ai-application).\n\nTo stop and remove the Pod, run:\n\n```\npodman pod stop chatbot\npodman pod rm chatbot\n```\n\n## Download a model\n\nIf you are just getting started, we recommend using [granite-3.3-8b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct). This is a well\nperformant mid-sized model with an apache-2.0 license. In order to use it with our Model Service we need it converted\nand quantized into the [GGUF format](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md). There are a number of\nways to get a GGUF version of granite-3.3-8b-instruct, but the simplest is to download a pre-converted one from\n[huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) here: https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-GGUF.\n\nThe recommended model can be downloaded using the code snippet below:\n\n```bash\ncd ../../../models\ncurl -sLO https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf\ncd ../recipes/natural_language_processing/chatbot\n```\n\n_A full list of supported open models is forthcoming._  \n\n\n## Build the Model Service\n\nThe complete instructions for building and deploying the Model Service can be found in the\n[llamacpp_python model-service document](../../../model_servers/llamacpp_python/README.md).\n\nThe Model Service can be built from make commands from the [llamacpp_python directory](../../../model_servers/llamacpp_python/).\n\n```bash\n# from path model_servers/llamacpp_python from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes\nmake build\n```\nCheckout the [Makefile](../../../model_servers/llamacpp_python/Makefile) to get more details on different options for how to build.\n\n## Deploy the Model Service\n\nThe local Model Service relies on a volume mount to the localhost to access the model files. It also employs environment variables to dictate the model used and where its served. You can start your local Model Service using the following `make` command from `model_servers/llamacpp_python` set with reasonable defaults:\n\n```bash\n# from path model_servers/llamacpp_python from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes\nmake run\n```\n\n## Build the AI Application\n\nThe AI Application can be built from the make command:\n\n```bash\n# Run this from the current directory (path recipes/natural_language_processing/chatbot from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes)\nmake build\n```\n\n## Deploy the AI Application\n\nMake sure the Model Service is up and running before starting this container image. When starting the AI Application container image we need to direct it to the correct `MODEL_ENDPOINT`. This could be any appropriately hosted Model Service (running locally or in the cloud) using an OpenAI compatible API. In our case the Model Service is running inside the Podman machine so we need to provide it with the appropriate address `10.88.0.1`. To deploy the AI application use the following:\n\n```bash\n# Run this from the current directory (path recipes/natural_language_processing/chatbot from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes)\nmake run \n```\n\n## Interact with the AI Application\n\nEverything should now be up an running with the chat application available at [`http://localhost:8501`](http://localhost:8501). By using this recipe and getting this starting point established, users should now have an easier time customizing and building their own LLM enabled chatbot applications.   \n\n## Embed the AI Application in a Bootable Container Image\n\nTo build a bootable container image that includes this sample chatbot workload as a service that starts when a system is booted, run: `make -f Makefile bootc`. You can optionally override the default image / tag you want to give the make command by specifying it as follows: `make -f Makefile BOOTC_IMAGE=<your_bootc_image> bootc`.\n\nSubstituting the bootc/Containerfile FROM command is simple using the Makefile FROM option.\n\n```bash\nmake FROM=registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc:9.4 bootc\n```\n\nSelecting the ARCH for the bootc/Containerfile is simple using the Makefile ARCH= variable.\n\n```\nmake ARCH=x86_64 bootc\n```\n\nThe magic happens when you have a bootc enabled system running. If you do, and you'd like to update the operating system to the OS you just built\nwith the chatbot application, it's as simple as ssh-ing into the bootc system and running:\n\n```bash\nbootc switch quay.io/ai-lab/chatbot-bootc:latest\n```\n\nUpon a reboot, you'll see that the chatbot service is running on the system. Check on the service with:\n\n```bash\nssh user@bootc-system-ip\nsudo systemctl status chatbot\n```\n\n### What are bootable containers?\n\nWhat's a [bootable OCI container](https://containers.github.io/bootc/) and what's it got to do with AI?\n\nThat's a good question! We think it's a good idea to embed AI workloads (or any workload!) into bootable images at _build time_ rather than\nat _runtime_. This extends the benefits, such as portability and predictability, that containerizing applications provides to the operating system.\nBootable OCI images bake exactly what you need to run your workloads into the operating system at build time by using your favorite containerization\ntools. Might I suggest [podman](https://podman.io/)?\n\nOnce installed, a bootc enabled system can be updated by providing an updated bootable OCI image from any OCI\nimage registry with a single `bootc` command. This works especially well for fleets of devices that have fixed workloads - think\nfactories or appliances. Who doesn't want to add a little AI to their appliance, am I right?\n\nBootable images lend toward immutable operating systems, and the more immutable an operating system is, the less that can go wrong at runtime!\n\n#### Creating bootable disk images\n\nYou can convert a bootc image to a bootable disk image using the\n[quay.io/centos-bootc/bootc-image-builder](https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder) container image.\n\nThis container image allows you to build and deploy [multiple disk image types](../../common/README_bootc_image_builder.md) from bootc container images.\n\nDefault image types can be set via the DISK_TYPE Makefile variable.\n\n`make bootc-image-builder DISK_TYPE=ami`\n",

Please review the [Makefile docs](../../common/README.md), to learn about further customizing your application.\n\n\nThis application requires a model, a model service and an AI inferencing application.\n\n* [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n* [Download a model](#download-a-model)\n* [Build the Model Service](#build-the-model-service)\n* [Deploy the Model Service](#deploy-the-model-service)\n* [Build the AI Application](#build-the-ai-application)\n* [Deploy the AI Application](#deploy-the-ai-application)\n* [Interact with the AI Application](#interact-with-the-ai-application)\n* [Embed the AI Application in a Bootable Container Image](#embed-the-ai-application-in-a-bootable-container-image)\n\n\n## Quickstart\nTo run the application with pre-built images from `quay.io/ai-lab`, use `make quadlet`. This command\nbuilds the application's metadata and generates Kubernetes YAML at `./build/summarizer.yaml` to spin up a Pod that can then be launched locally.\nTry it with:\n\n```\nmake quadlet\npodman kube play build/summarizer.yaml\n```\n\nThis will take a few minutes if the model and model-server container images need to be downloaded. \nThe Pod is named `summarizer`, so you may use [Podman](https://podman.io) to manage the Pod and its containers:\n\n```\npodman pod list\npodman ps\n```\n\nOnce the Pod and its containers are running, the application can be accessed at `http://localhost:8501`. \nPlease refer to the section below for more details about [interacting with the summarizer application](#interact-with-the-ai-application).\n\nTo stop and remove the Pod, run:\n\n```\npodman pod stop summarizer\npodman pod rm summarizer\n```\n\n## Download a model\n\nIf you are just getting started, we recommend using [granite-3.3-8b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct). This is a well\nperformant mid-sized model with an apache-2.0 license. In order to use it with our Model Service we need it converted\nand quantized into the [GGUF format](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md). There are a number of\nways to get a GGUF version of granite-3.3-8b-instruct, but the simplest is to download a pre-converted one from\n[huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) here: https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-GGUF.\n\nThe recommended model can be downloaded using the code snippet below:\n\n```bash\ncd ../../../models\ncurl -sLO https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf\ncd ../recipes/natural_language_processing/summarizer\n```\n\n_A full list of supported open models is forthcoming._  \n\n\n## Build the Model Service\n\nThe complete instructions for building and deploying the Model Service can be found in the\n[llamacpp_python model-service document](../../../model_servers/llamacpp_python/README.md).\n\nThe Model Service can be built from make commands from the [llamacpp_python directory](../../../model_servers/llamacpp_python/).\n\n```bash\n# from path model_servers/llamacpp_python from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes\nmake build\n```\nCheckout the [Makefile](../../../model_servers/llamacpp_python/Makefile) to get more details on different options for how to build.\n\n## Deploy the Model Service\n\nThe local Model Service relies on a volume mount to the localhost to access the model files. It also employs environment variables to dictate the model used and where its served. You can start your local Model Service using the following `make` command from `model_servers/llamacpp_python` set with reasonable defaults:\n\n```bash\n# from path model_servers/llamacpp_python from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes\nmake run\n```\n\n## Build the AI Application\n\nThe AI Application can be built from the make command:\n\n```bash\n# Run this from the current directory (path recipes/natural_language_processing/summarizer from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes)\nmake build\n```\n\n## Deploy the AI Application\n\nMake sure the Model Service is up and running before starting this container image. When starting the AI Application container image we need to direct it to the correct `MODEL_ENDPOINT`. This could be any appropriately hosted Model Service (running locally or in the cloud) using an OpenAI compatible API. In our case the Model Service is running inside the Podman machine so we need to provide it with the appropriate address `10.88.0.1`. To deploy the AI application use the following:\n\n```bash\n# Run this from the current directory (path recipes/natural_language_processing/summarizer from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes)\nmake run \n```\n\n## Interact with the AI Application\n\nEverything should now be up an running with the summarizer application available at [`http://localhost:8501`](http://localhost:8501). By using this recipe and getting this starting point established, users should now have an easier time customizing and building their own LLM enabled summarizer applications.   \n\n## Embed the AI Application in a Bootable Container Image\n\nTo build a bootable container image that includes this sample summarizer workload as a service that starts when a system is booted, run: `make -f Makefile bootc`. You can optionally override the default image / tag you want to give the make command by specifying it as follows: `make -f Makefile BOOTC_IMAGE=<your_bootc_image> bootc`.\n\nSubstituting the bootc/Containerfile FROM command is simple using the Makefile FROM option.\n\n```bash\nmake FROM=registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc:9.4 bootc\n```\n\nSelecting the ARCH for the bootc/Containerfile is simple using the Makefile ARCH= variable.\n\n```\nmake ARCH=x86_64 bootc\n```\n\nThe magic happens when you have a bootc enabled system running. If you do, and you'd like to update the operating system to the OS you just built\nwith the summarizer application, it's as simple as ssh-ing into the bootc system and running:\n\n```bash\nbootc switch quay.io/ai-lab/summarizer-bootc:latest\n```\n\nUpon a reboot, you'll see that the summarizer service is running on the system. Check on the service with:\n\n```bash\nssh user@bootc-system-ip\nsudo systemctl status summarizer\n```\n\n### What are bootable containers?\n\nWhat's a [bootable OCI container](https://containers.github.io/bootc/) and what's it got to do with AI?\n\nThat's a good question! We think it's a good idea to embed AI workloads (or any workload!) into bootable images at _build time_ rather than\nat _runtime_. This extends the benefits, such as portability and predictability, that containerizing applications provides to the operating system.\nBootable OCI images bake exactly what you need to run your workloads into the operating system at build time by using your favorite containerization\ntools. Might I suggest [podman](https://podman.io/)?\n\nOnce installed, a bootc enabled system can be updated by providing an updated bootable OCI image from any OCI\nimage registry with a single `bootc` command. This works especially well for fleets of devices that have fixed workloads - think\nfactories or appliances. Who doesn't want to add a little AI to their appliance, am I right?\n\nBootable images lend toward immutable operating systems, and the more immutable an operating system is, the less that can go wrong at runtime!\n\n#### Creating bootable disk images\n\nYou can convert a bootc image to a bootable disk image using the\n[quay.io/centos-bootc/bootc-image-builder](https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder) container image.\n\nThis container image allows you to build and deploy [multiple disk image types](../../common/README_bootc_image_builder.md) from bootc container images.\n\nDefault image types can be set via the DISK_TYPE Makefile variable.\n\n`make bootc-image-builder DISK_TYPE=ami`\n",

It consists of three main components; the Model Service, the Vector Database and the AI Application.\n\nThere are a few options today for local Model Serving, but this recipe will use [`llama-cpp-python`](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) and their OpenAI compatible Model Service. There is a Containerfile provided that can be used to build this Model Service within the repo, [`model_servers/llamacpp_python/base/Containerfile`](/model_servers/llamacpp_python/base/Containerfile).\n\nIn order for the LLM to interact with our documents, we need them stored and available in such a manner that we can retrieve a small subset of them that are relevant to our query. To do this we employ a Vector Database alongside an embedding model. The embedding model converts our documents into numerical representations, vectors, such that similarity searches can be easily performed. The Vector Database stores these vectors for us and makes them available to the LLM. In this recipe we can use [chromaDB](https://docs.trychroma.com/) or [Milvus](https://milvus.io/) as our Vector Database.\n\nOur AI Application will connect to our Model Service via it's OpenAI compatible API. In this example we rely on [Langchain's](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) python package to simplify communication with our Model Service and we use [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for our UI layer. Below please see an example of the RAG application.     \n\n![](/assets/rag_ui.png)\n\n\n## Try the RAG chat application\n\n_COMING SOON to AI LAB_\nThe [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io) [AI Lab Extension](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-ai-lab) includes this recipe among others. To try it out, open `Recipes Catalog` -> `RAG Chatbot` and follow the instructions to start the application.\n\nIf you prefer building and running the application from terminal, please run the following commands from this directory.\n\nFirst, build application's meta data and run the generated Kubernetes YAML which will spin up a Pod along with a number of containers:\n```\nmake quadlet\npodman kube play build/rag.yaml\n```\n\nThe Pod is named `rag`, so you may use [Podman](https://podman.io) to manage the Pod and its containers:\n```\npodman pod list\npodman ps\n```\n\nTo stop and remove the Pod, run:\n```\npodman pod stop rag\npodman pod rm rag\n```\n\nOnce the Pod is running, please refer to the section below to [interact with the RAG chatbot application](#interact-with-the-ai-application).\n\n# Build the Application\n\nIn order to build this application we will need two models, a Vector Database, a Model Service and an AI Application.  \n\n* [Download models](#download-models)\n* [Deploy the Vector Database](#deploy-the-vector-database)\n* [Build the Model Service](#build-the-model-service)\n* [Deploy the Model Service](#deploy-the-model-service)\n* [Build the AI Application](#build-the-ai-application)\n* [Deploy the AI Application](#deploy-the-ai-application)\n* [Interact with the AI Application](#interact-with-the-ai-application)\n\n### Download models\n\nIf you are just getting started, we recommend using [granite-3.3-8b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-GGUF). This is a well\nperformant mid-sized model with an apache-2.0 license that has been quanitzed and served into the [GGUF format](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md).\n\nThe recommended model can be downloaded using the code snippet below:\n\n```bash\ncd ../../../models\ncurl -sLO https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf\ncd ../recipes/natural_language_processing/rag\n```\n\n_A full list of supported open models is forthcoming._  \n\nIn addition to the LLM, RAG applications also require an embedding model to convert documents between natural language and vector representations. For this demo we will use [`BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) it is a fairly standard model for this use case and has an MIT license.    \n\nThe code snippet below can be used to pull a copy of the `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` embedding model and store it in your `models/` directory. \n\n```python \nfrom huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\nsnapshot_download(repo_id=\"BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5\",\n                cache_dir=\"models/\",\n                local_files_only=False)\n```\n\n### Deploy the Vector Database \n\nTo deploy the Vector Database service locally, simply use the existing ChromaDB or Milvus image. The Vector Database is ephemeral and will need to be re-populated each time the container restarts. When implementing RAG in production, you will want a long running and backed up Vector Database.\n\n\n#### ChromaDB\n```bash\npodman pull chromadb/chroma\n```\n```bash\npodman run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 chroma\n```\n#### Milvus\n```bash\npodman pull milvusdb/milvus:master-20240426-bed6363f\n```\n```bash\npodman run -it \\\n        --name milvus-standalone \\\n        --security-opt seccomp:unconfined \\\n        -e ETCD_USE_EMBED=true \\\n        -e ETCD_CONFIG_PATH=/milvus/configs/embedEtcd.yaml \\\n        -e COMMON_STORAGETYPE=local \\\n        -v $(pwd)/volumes/milvus:/var/lib/milvus \\\n        -v $(pwd)/embedEtcd.yaml:/milvus/configs/embedEtcd.yaml \\\n        -p 19530:19530 \\\n        -p 9091:9091 \\\n        -p 2379:2379 \\\n        --health-cmd=\"curl -f http://localhost:9091/healthz\" \\\n        --health-interval=30s \\\n        --health-start-period=90s \\\n        --health-timeout=20s \\\n        --health-retries=3 \\\n        milvusdb/milvus:master-20240426-bed6363f \\\n        milvus run standalone  1> /dev/null\n```\nNote: For running the Milvus instance, make sure you have the `$(pwd)/volumes/milvus` directory and `$(pwd)/embedEtcd.yaml` file as shown in this repository. These are required by the database for its operations.\n\n\n### Build the Model Service\n\nThe complete instructions for building and deploying the Model Service can be found in the [the llamacpp_python model-service document](../model_servers/llamacpp_python/README.md).\n\nThe Model Service can be built with the following code snippet:\n\n```bash\ncd model_servers/llamacpp_python\npodman build -t llamacppserver -f ./base/Containerfile .\n```\n\n\n### Deploy the Model Service\n\nThe complete instructions for building and deploying the Model Service can be found in the [the llamacpp_python model-service document](../model_servers/llamacpp_python/README.md).\n\nThe local Model Service relies on a volume mount to the localhost to access the model files. You can start your local Model Service using the following Podman command:\n```\npodman run --rm -it \\\n        -p 8001:8001 \\\n        -v Local/path/to/locallm/models:/locallm/models \\\n        -e MODEL_PATH=models/<model-filename> \\\n        -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \\\n        -e PORT=8001 \\\n        llamacppserver\n```\n\n### Build the AI Application\n\nNow that the Model Service is running we want to build and deploy our AI Application. Use the provided Containerfile to build the AI Application image in the `rag-langchain/` directory.\n\n```bash\ncd rag\nmake APP_IMAGE=rag build\n```\n\n### Deploy the AI Application\n\nMake sure the Model Service and the Vector Database are up and running before starting this container image. When starting the AI Application container image we need to direct it to the correct `MODEL_ENDPOINT`. This could be any appropriately hosted Model Service (running locally or in the cloud) using an OpenAI compatible API. In our case the Model Service is running inside the Podman machine so we need to provide it with the appropriate address `10.88.0.1`. The same goes for the Vector Database. Make sure the `VECTORDB_HOST` is correctly set to `10.88.0.1` for communication within the Podman virtual machine.\n\nThere also needs to be a volume mount into the `models/` directory so that the application can access the embedding model as well as a volume mount into the `data/` directory where it can pull documents from to populate the Vector Database.  \n\nThe following Podman command can be used to run your AI Application:\n\n```bash\npodman run --rm -it -p 8501:8501 \\\n-e MODEL_ENDPOINT=http://10.88.0.1:8001 \\\n-e VECTORDB_HOST=10.88.0.1 \\\n-v Local/path/to/locallm/models/:/rag/models \\\nrag   \n```\n\n### Interact with the AI Application\n\nEverything should now be up an running with the rag application available at [`http://localhost:8501`](http://localhost:8501). By using this recipe and getting this starting point established, users should now have an easier time customizing and building their own LLM enabled RAG applications.   \n\n### Embed the AI Application in a Bootable Container Image\n\nTo build a bootable container image that includes this sample RAG chatbot workload as a service that starts when a system is booted, cd into this folder\nand run:\n\n\n```\nmake BOOTC_IMAGE=quay.io/your/rag-bootc:latest bootc\n```\n\nSubstituting the bootc/Containerfile FROM command is simple using the Makefile FROM option.\n\n```\nmake FROM=registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc:9.4 BOOTC_IMAGE=quay.io/your/rag-bootc:latest bootc\n```\n\nThe magic happens when you have a bootc enabled system running. If you do, and you'd like to update the operating system to the OS you just built\nwith the RAG chatbot application, it's as simple as ssh-ing into the bootc system and running:\n\n```\nbootc switch quay.io/your/rag-bootc:latest\n```\n\nUpon a reboot, you'll see that the RAG chatbot service is running on the system.\n\nCheck on the service with\n\n```\nssh user@bootc-system-ip\nsudo systemctl status rag\n```\n\n#### What are bootable containers?\n\nWhat's a [bootable OCI container](https://containers.github.io/bootc/) and what's it got to do with AI?\n\nThat's a good question! We think it's a good idea to embed AI workloads (or any workload!) into bootable images at _build time_ rather than\nat _runtime_. This extends the benefits, such as portability and predictability, that containerizing applications provides to the operating system.\nBootable OCI images bake exactly what you need to run your workloads into the operating system at build time by using your favorite containerization\ntools. Might I suggest [podman](https://podman.io/)?\n\nOnce installed, a bootc enabled system can be updated by providing an updated bootable OCI image from any OCI\nimage registry with a single `bootc` command. This works especially well for fleets of devices that have fixed workloads - think\nfactories or appliances. Who doesn't want to add a little AI to their appliance, am I right?\n\nBootable images lend toward immutable operating systems, and the more immutable an operating system is, the less that can go wrong at runtime!\n\n##### Creating bootable disk images\n\nYou can convert a bootc image to a bootable disk image using the\n[quay.io/centos-bootc/bootc-image-builder](https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder) container image.\n\nThis container image allows you to build and deploy [multiple disk image types](../../common/README_bootc_image_builder.md) from bootc container images.\n\nDefault image types can be set via the DISK_TYPE Makefile variable.\n\n`make bootc-image-builder DISK_TYPE=ami`\n\n### Makefile variables\n\nThere are several [Makefile variables](../../common/README.md) defined within each `recipe` Makefile which can be\nused to override defaults for a variety of make targets.\n",

      "readme": "# RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Chat Application\n\nThis demo provides a simple recipe to help Node.js developers start to build out their own custom RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) applications. It consists of three main components; the Model Service, the Vector Database and the AI Application.\n\nThere are a few options today for local Model Serving, but this recipe will use [`llama-cpp-python`](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) and their OpenAI compatible Model Service. There is a Containerfile provided that can be used to build this Model Service within the repo, [`model_servers/llamacpp_python/base/Containerfile`](/model_servers/llamacpp_python/base/Containerfile).\n\nIn order for the LLM to interact with our documents, we need them stored and available in such a manner that we can retrieve a small subset of them that are relevant to our query. To do this we employ a Vector Database alongside an embedding model. The embedding model converts our documents into numerical representations, vectors, such that similarity searches can be easily performed. The Vector Database stores these vectors for us and makes them available to the LLM. In this recipe we can use [chromaDB](https://docs.trychroma.com/) as our Vector Database.\n\nOur AI Application will connect to our Model Service via it's OpenAI compatible API. In this example we rely on [Langchain's](https://js.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) package to simplify communication with our Model Service and we use [React Chatbotify](https://react-chatbotify.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for our UI layer. Below please see an example of the RAG application.     \n\n![](/assets/rag_nodejs.png)\n\n\n## Try the RAG chat application\n\n_COMING SOON to AI LAB_\nThe [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io) [AI Lab Extension](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-ai-lab) includes this recipe among others. To try it out, open `Recipes Catalog` -> `RAG Node.js Chatbot` and follow the instructions to start the application.\n\nIf you prefer building and running the application from terminal, please run the following commands from this directory.\n\nFirst, build application's meta data and run the generated Kubernetes YAML which will spin up a Pod along with a number of containers:\n```\nmake quadlet\npodman kube play build/rag-nodesjs.yaml\n```\n\nThe Pod is named `rag_nodejs`, so you may use [Podman](https://podman.io) to manage the Pod and its containers:\n```\npodman pod list\npodman ps\n```\n\nTo stop and remove the Pod, run:\n```\npodman pod stop rag_nodejs\npodman pod rm rag_nodejs\n```\n\nOnce the Pod is running, please refer to the section below to [interact with the RAG chatbot application](#interact-with-the-ai-application).\n\n# Build the Application\n\nIn order to build this application we will need two models, a Vector Database, a Model Service and an AI Application.  \n\n* [Download models](#download-models)\n* [Deploy the Vector Database](#deploy-the-vector-database)\n* [Build the Model Service](#build-the-model-service)\n* [Deploy the Model Service](#deploy-the-model-service)\n* [Build the AI Application](#build-the-ai-application)\n* [Deploy the AI Application](#deploy-the-ai-application)\n* [Interact with the AI Application](#interact-with-the-ai-application)\n\n### Download models\n\nIf you are just getting started, we recommend using [granite-3.3-8b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-GGUF). This is a well\nperformant mid-sized model with an apache-2.0 license that has been quanitzed and served into the [GGUF format](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md).\n\nThe recommended model can be downloaded using the code snippet below:\n\n```bash\ncd ../../../models\ncurl -sLO https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf\ncd ../recipes/natural_language_processing/rag_nodejs\n```\n\n_A full list of supported open models is forthcoming._  \n\n### Deploy the Vector Database \n\nTo deploy the Vector Database service locally, simply use the existing ChromaDB. The Vector Database is ephemeral and will need to be re-populated each time the container restarts. When implementing RAG in production, you will want a long running and backed up Vector Database.\n\n\n#### ChromaDB\n```bash\npodman pull chromadb/chroma\n```\n```bash\npodman run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 chroma\n```\n\n### Build the Model Service\n\nThe complete instructions for building and deploying the Model Service can be found in the [the llamacpp_python model-service document](../model_servers/llamacpp_python/README.md).\n\nThe Model Service can be built with the following code snippet:\n\n```bash\ncd model_servers/llamacpp_python\npodman build -t llamacppserver -f ./base/Containerfile .\n```\n\n\n### Deploy the Model Service\n\nThe complete instructions for building and deploying the Model Service can be found in the [the llamacpp_python model-service document](../model_servers/llamacpp_python/README.md).\n\nThe local Model Service relies on a volume mount to the localhost to access the model files. You can start your local Model Service using the following Podman command:\n```\npodman run --rm -it \\\n        -p 8001:8001 \\\n        -v Local/path/to/locallm/models:/locallm/models \\\n        -e MODEL_PATH=models/<model-filename> \\\n        -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \\\n        -e PORT=8001 \\\n        llamacppserver\n```\n\n### Build the AI Application\n\nNow that the Model Service is running we want to build and deploy our AI Application. Use the provided Containerfile to build the AI Application image in the `rag-nodejs/` directory.\n\n```bash\ncd rag-nodejs\nmake APP_IMAGE=rag-nodejs build\n```\n\n### Deploy the AI Application\n\nMake sure the Model Service and the Vector Database are up and running before starting this container image. When starting the AI Application container image we need to direct it to the correct `MODEL_ENDPOINT`. This could be any appropriately hosted Model Service (running locally or in the cloud) using an OpenAI compatible API. In our case the Model Service is running inside the Podman machine so we need to provide it with the appropriate address `10.88.0.1`. The same goes for the Vector Database. Make sure the `VECTORDB_HOST` is correctly set to `10.88.0.1` for communication within the Podman virtual machine.\n\nThere also needs to be a volume mount into the `models/` directory so that the application can access the embedding model as well as a volume mount into the `data/` directory where it can pull documents from to populate the Vector Database.  \n\nThe following Podman command can be used to run your AI Application:\n\n```bash\npodman run --rm -it -p 8501:8501 \\\n-e MODEL_ENDPOINT=http://10.88.0.1:8001 \\\n-e VECTORDB_HOST=10.88.0.1 \\\n-v Local/path/to/locallm/models/:/rag/models \\\nrag-nodejs   \n```\n\n### Interact with the AI Application\n\nEverything should now be up an running with the rag application available at [`http://localhost:8501`](http://localhost:8501). By using this recipe and getting this starting point established, users should now have an easier time customizing and building their own LLM enabled RAG applications.   \n\n### Embed the AI Application in a Bootable Container Image\n\nTo build a bootable container image that includes this sample RAG chatbot workload as a service that starts when a system is booted, cd into this folder\nand run:\n\n\n```\nmake BOOTC_IMAGE=quay.io/your/rag-nodejs-bootc:latest bootc\n```\n\nSubstituting the bootc/Containerfile FROM command is simple using the Makefile FROM option.\n\n```\nmake FROM=registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc:9.4 BOOTC_IMAGE=quay.io/your/rag-nodejs-bootc:latest bootc\n```\n\nThe magic happens when you have a bootc enabled system running. If you do, and you'd like to update the operating system to the OS you just built\nwith the RAG Node.js chatbot application, it's as simple as ssh-ing into the bootc system and running:\n\n```\nbootc switch quay.io/your/rag-nodejs-bootc:latest\n```\n\nUpon a reboot, you'll see that the RAG Node.js chatbot service is running on the system.\n\nCheck on the service with\n\n```\nssh user@bootc-system-ip\nsudo systemctl status raa-nodejsg\n```\n\n#### What are bootable containers?\n\nWhat's a [bootable OCI container](https://containers.github.io/bootc/) and what's it got to do with AI?\n\nThat's a good question! We think it's a good idea to embed AI workloads (or any workload!) into bootable images at _build time_ rather than\nat _runtime_. This extends the benefits, such as portability and predictability, that containerizing applications provides to the operating system.\nBootable OCI images bake exactly what you need to run your workloads into the operating system at build time by using your favorite containerization\ntools. Might I suggest [podman](https://podman.io/)?\n\nOnce installed, a bootc enabled system can be updated by providing an updated bootable OCI image from any OCI\nimage registry with a single `bootc` command. This works especially well for fleets of devices that have fixed workloads - think\nfactories or appliances. Who doesn't want to add a little AI to their appliance, am I right?\n\nBootable images lend toward immutable operating systems, and the more immutable an operating system is, the less that can go wrong at runtime!\n\n##### Creating bootable disk images\n\nYou can convert a bootc image to a bootable disk image using the\n[quay.io/centos-bootc/bootc-image-builder](https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder) container image.\n\nThis container image allows you to build and deploy [multiple disk image types](../../common/README_bootc_image_builder.md) from bootc container images.\n\nDefault image types can be set via the DISK_TYPE Makefile variable.\n\n`make bootc-image-builder DISK_TYPE=ami`\n\n### Makefile variables\n\nThere are several [Makefile variables](../../common/README.md) defined within each `recipe` Makefile which can be\nused to override defaults for a variety of make targets.\n",

All the recipes use a central [Makefile](../../common/Makefile.common) that includes variables populated with default values to simplify getting started. Please review the [Makefile docs](../../common/README.md), to learn about further customizing your application.\n\n\nThis application requires a model, a model service and an AI inferencing application.\n\n* [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n* [Download a model](#download-a-model)\n* [Build the Model Service](#build-the-model-service)\n* [Deploy the Model Service](#deploy-the-model-service)\n* [Build the AI Application](#build-the-ai-application)\n* [Deploy the AI Application](#deploy-the-ai-application)\n* [Interact with the AI Application](#interact-with-the-ai-application)\n* [Embed the AI Application in a Bootable Container Image](#embed-the-ai-application-in-a-bootable-container-image)\n\n\n## Quickstart\nTo run the application with pre-built images from `quay.io/ai-lab`, use `make quadlet`. This command\nbuilds the application's metadata and generates Kubernetes YAML at `./build/chatbot-nodejs.yaml` to spin up a Pod that can then be launched locally.\nTry it with:\n\n```\nmake quadlet\npodman kube play build/chatbot-nodejs.yaml\n```\n\nThis will take a few minutes if the model and model-server container images need to be downloaded. \nThe Pod is named `nodejs chat app`, so you may use [Podman](https://podman.io) to manage the Pod and its containers:\n\n```\npodman pod list\npodman ps\n```\n\nOnce the Pod and its containers are running, the application can be accessed at `http://localhost:8501`. \nPlease refer to the section below for more details about [interacting with the chatbot application](#interact-with-the-ai-application).\n\nTo stop and remove the Pod, run:\n\n```\npodman pod stop chatbot-nodejs\npodman pod rm chatbot-nodejs\n```\n\n## Download a model\n\nIf you are just getting started, we recommend using [granite-3.3-8b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct). This is a well\nperformant mid-sized model with an apache-2.0 license. In order to use it with our Model Service we need it converted\nand quantized into the [GGUF format](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md). There are a number of\nways to get a GGUF version of granite-3.3-8b-instruct, but the simplest is to download a pre-converted one from\n[huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) here: https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-GGUF.\n\nThe recommended model can be downloaded using the code snippet below:\n\n```bash\ncd ../../../models\ncurl -sLO https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf\ncd ../recipes/natural_language_processing/chatbot-nodejs\n```\n\n_A full list of supported open models is forthcoming._  \n\n\n## Build the Model Service\n\nThe complete instructions for building and deploying the Model Service can be found in the\n[llamacpp_python model-service document](../../../model_servers/llamacpp_python/README.md).\n\nThe Model Service can be built from make commands from the [llamacpp_python directory](../../../model_servers/llamacpp_python/).\n\n```bash\n# from path model_servers/llamacpp_python from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes\nmake build\n```\nCheckout the [Makefile](../../../model_servers/llamacpp_python/Makefile) to get more details on different options for how to build.\n\n## Deploy the Model Service\n\nThe local Model Service relies on a volume mount to the localhost to access the model files. It also employs environment variables to dictate the model used and where its served. You can start your local Model Service using the following `make` command from `model_servers/llamacpp_python` set with reasonable defaults:\n\n```bash\n# from path model_servers/llamacpp_python from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes\nmake run\n```\n\n## Build the AI Application\n\nThe AI Application can be built from the make command:\n\n```bash\n# Run this from the current directory (path recipes/natural_language_processing/chatbot-nodejs from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes)\nmake build\n```\n\n## Deploy the AI Application\n\nMake sure the Model Service is up and running before starting this container image.

By using this recipe and getting this starting point established, users should now have an easier time customizing and building their own LLM enabled chatbot applications.   \n\n## Embed the AI Application in a Bootable Container Image\n\nTo build a bootable container image that includes this sample chatbot workload as a service that starts when a system is booted, run: `make -f Makefile bootc`. You can optionally override the default image / tag you want to give the make command by specifying it as follows: `make -f Makefile BOOTC_IMAGE=<your_bootc_image> bootc`.\n\nSubstituting the bootc/Containerfile FROM command is simple using the Makefile FROM option.\n\n```bash\nmake FROM=registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc:9.4 bootc\n```\n\nSelecting the ARCH for the bootc/Containerfile is simple using the Makefile ARCH= variable.\n\n```\nmake ARCH=x86_64 bootc\n```\n\nThe magic happens when you have a bootc enabled system running. If you do, and you'd like to update the operating system to the OS you just built\nwith the chatbot application, it's as simple as ssh-ing into the bootc system and running:\n\n```bash\nbootc switch quay.io/ai-lab/chatbot-nodejs-bootc:latest\n```\n\nUpon a reboot, you'll see that the chatbot service is running on the system. Check on the service with:\n\n```bash\nssh user@bootc-system-ip\nsudo systemctl status chatbot-nodejs\n```\n\n### What are bootable containers?\n\nWhat's a [bootable OCI container](https://containers.github.io/bootc/) and what's it got to do with AI?\n\nThat's a good question! We think it's a good idea to embed AI workloads (or any workload!) into bootable images at _build time_ rather than\nat _runtime_. This extends the benefits, such as portability and predictability, that containerizing applications provides to the operating system.\nBootable OCI images bake exactly what you need to run your workloads into the operating system at build time by using your favorite containerization\ntools.

This works especially well for fleets of devices that have fixed workloads - think\nfactories or appliances. Who doesn't want to add a little AI to their appliance, am I right?\n\nBootable images lend toward immutable operating systems, and the more immutable an operating system is, the less that can go wrong at runtime!\n\n#### Creating bootable disk images\n\nYou can convert a bootc image to a bootable disk image using the\n[quay.io/centos-bootc/bootc-image-builder](https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder) container image.\n\nThis container image allows you to build and deploy [multiple disk image types](../../common/README_bootc_image_builder.md) from bootc container images.\n\nDefault image types can be set via the DISK_TYPE Makefile variable.\n\n`make bootc-image-builder DISK_TYPE=ami`\n",

You can find an example of the chat application below.\n\n![](/assets/chatbot_ui.png) \n\n\n## Try the Function Calling Application\n\nThe [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io) [AI Lab Extension](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-ai-lab) includes this recipe among others. To try it out, open `Recipes Catalog` -> `Function Calling` and follow the instructions to start the application.\n\n# Build the Application\n\nThe rest of this document will explain how to build and run the application from the terminal, and will\ngo into greater detail on how each container in the Pod above is built, run, and \nwhat purpose it serves in the overall application. All the recipes use a central [Makefile](../../common/Makefile.common) that includes variables populated with default values to simplify getting started. Please review the [Makefile docs](../../common/README.md), to learn about further customizing your application.\n\n\nThis application requires a model, a model service and an AI inferencing application.\n\n* [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n* [Download a model](#download-a-model)\n* [Build the Model Service](#build-the-model-service)\n* [Deploy the Model Service](#deploy-the-model-service)\n* [Build the AI Application](#build-the-ai-application)\n* [Deploy the AI Application](#deploy-the-ai-application)\n* [Interact with the AI Application](#interact-with-the-ai-application)\n* [Embed the AI Application in a Bootable Container Image](#embed-the-ai-application-in-a-bootable-container-image)\n\n\n## Quickstart\nTo run the application with pre-built images from `quay.io/ai-lab`, use `make quadlet`.

This is a well\nperformant mid-sized model with an apache-2.0 license. In order to use it with our Model Service we need it converted\nand quantized into the [GGUF format](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md). There are a number of\nways to get a GGUF version of granite-3.3-8b-instruct, but the simplest is to download a pre-converted one from\n[huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) here: https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-GGUF.\n\nThe recommended model can be downloaded using the code snippet below:\n\n```bash\ncd ../../../models\ncurl -sLO https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf\ncd ../recipes/natural_language_processing/chatbot\n```\n\n_A full list of supported open models is forthcoming._  \n\n\n## Build the Model Service\n\nThe complete instructions for building and deploying the Model Service can be found in the\n[llamacpp_python model-service document](../../../model_servers/llamacpp_python/README.md).\n\nThe Model Service can be built from make commands from the [llamacpp_python directory](../../../model_servers/llamacpp_python/).\n\n```bash\n# from path model_servers/llamacpp_python from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes\nmake build\n```\nCheckout the [Makefile](../../../model_servers/llamacpp_python/Makefile) to get more details on different options for how to build.\n\n## Deploy the Model Service\n\nThe local Model Service relies on a volume mount to the localhost to access the model files. It also employs environment variables to dictate the model used and where its served. You can start your local Model Service using the following `make` command from `model_servers/llamacpp_python` set with reasonable defaults:\n\n```bash\n# from path model_servers/llamacpp_python from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes\nmake run\n```\n\n## Build the AI Application\n\nThe AI Application can be built from the make command:\n\n```bash\n# Run this from the current directory (path recipes/natural_language_processing/chatbot from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes)\nmake build\n```\n\n## Deploy the AI Application\n\nMake sure the Model Service is up and running before starting this container image. When starting the AI Application container image we need to direct it to the correct `MODEL_ENDPOINT`. This could be any appropriately hosted Model Service (running locally or in the cloud) using an OpenAI compatible API. In our case the Model Service is running inside the Podman machine so we need to provide it with the appropriate address `10.88.0.1`. To deploy the AI application use the following:\n\n```bash\n# Run this from the current directory (path recipes/natural_language_processing/chatbot from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes)\nmake run \n```\n\n## Interact with the AI Application\n\nEverything should now be up an running with the chat application available at [`http://localhost:8501`](http://localhost:8501). By using this recipe and getting this starting point established, users should now have an easier time customizing and building their own LLM enabled chatbot applications.   \n\n## Embed the AI Application in a Bootable Container Image\n\nTo build a bootable container image that includes this sample chatbot workload as a service that starts when a system is booted, run: `make -f Makefile bootc`. You can optionally override the default image / tag you want to give the make command by specifying it as follows: `make -f Makefile BOOTC_IMAGE=<your_bootc_image> bootc`.\n\nSubstituting the bootc/Containerfile FROM command is simple using the Makefile FROM option.\n\n```bash\nmake FROM=registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc:9.4 bootc\n```\n\nSelecting the ARCH for the bootc/Containerfile is simple using the Makefile ARCH= variable.\n\n```\nmake ARCH=x86_64 bootc\n```\n\nThe magic happens when you have a bootc enabled system running. If you do, and you'd like to update the operating system to the OS you just built\nwith the chatbot application, it's as simple as ssh-ing into the bootc system and running:\n\n```bash\nbootc switch quay.io/ai-lab/chatbot-bootc:latest\n```\n\nUpon a reboot, you'll see that the chatbot service is running on the system. Check on the service with:\n\n```bash\nssh user@bootc-system-ip\nsudo systemctl status chatbot\n```\n\n### What are bootable containers?\n\nWhat's a [bootable OCI container](https://containers.github.io/bootc/) and what's it got to do with AI?\n\nThat's a good question! We think it's a good idea to embed AI workloads (or any workload!) into bootable images at _build time_ rather than\nat _runtime_. This extends the benefits, such as portability and predictability, that containerizing applications provides to the operating system.\nBootable OCI images bake exactly what you need to run your workloads into the operating system at build time by using your favorite containerization\ntools. Might I suggest [podman](https://podman.io/)?\n\nOnce installed, a bootc enabled system can be updated by providing an updated bootable OCI image from any OCI\nimage registry with a single `bootc` command. This works especially well for fleets of devices that have fixed workloads - think\nfactories or appliances. Who doesn't want to add a little AI to their appliance, am I right?\n\nBootable images lend toward immutable operating systems, and the more immutable an operating system is, the less that can go wrong at runtime!\n\n#### Creating bootable disk images\n\nYou can convert a bootc image to a bootable disk image using the\n[quay.io/centos-bootc/bootc-image-builder](https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder) container image.\n\nThis container image allows you to build and deploy [multiple disk image types](../../common/README_bootc_image_builder.md) from bootc container images.\n\nDefault image types can be set via the DISK_TYPE Makefile variable.\n\n`make bootc-image-builder DISK_TYPE=ami`\n",

Might I suggest [podman](https://podman.io/)?\nOnce installed, a bootc enabled system can be updated by providing an updated bootable OCI image from any OCI image registry with a single `bootc` command. This works especially well for fleets of devices that have fixed workloads - think factories or appliances. Who doesn't want to add a little AI to their appliance, am I right?\nBootable images lend toward immutable operating systems, and the more immutable an operating system is, the less that can go wrong at runtime!\n\n#### Creating bootable disk images\nYou can convert a bootc image to a bootable disk image using the [quay.io/centos-bootc/bootc-image-builder](https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder) container image.\nThis container image allows you to build and deploy [multiple disk image types](../../common/README_bootc_image_builder.md) from bootc container images.\nDefault image types can be set via the DISK_TYPE Makefile variable.\n`make bootc-image-builder DISK_TYPE=ami`",

It consists of two main components: the Model Service and the AI Application.\n\nThere are a few options today for local Model Serving, but this recipe will use [`whisper-cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp.git) and its included Model Service. There is a Containerfile provided that can be used to build this Model Service within the repo, [`model_servers/whispercpp/base/Containerfile`](/model_servers/whispercpp/base/Containerfile).\n\nThe AI Application will connect to the Model Service via an API. The recipe relies on [Langchain's](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) python package to simplify communication with the Model Service and uses [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the UI layer. You can find an example of the audio to text application below.\n\n\n![](/assets/whisper.png) \n\n## Try the Audio to Text Application:\n\nThe [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io) [AI Lab Extension](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-ai-lab) includes this recipe among others. To try it out, open `Recipes Catalog` -> `Audio to Text` and follow the instructions to start the application.\n\n# Build the Application\n\nThe rest of this document will explain how to build and run the application from the terminal, and will go into greater detail on how each container in the application above is built, run, and  what purpose it serves in the overall application. All the recipes use a central [Makefile](../../common/Makefile.common) that includes variables populated with default values to simplify getting started. Please review the [Makefile docs](../../common/README.md), to learn about further customizing your application.\n\n* [Download a model](#download-a-model)\n* [Build the Model Service](#build-the-model-service)\n* [Deploy the Model Service](#deploy-the-model-service)\n* [Build the AI Application](#build-the-ai-application)\n* [Deploy the AI Application](#deploy-the-ai-application)\n* [Interact with the AI Application](#interact-with-the-ai-application)\n    * [Input audio files](#input-audio-files)\n\n## Download a model\n\nIf you are just getting started, we recommend using [ggerganov/whisper.cpp](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp).\nThis is a well performant model with an MIT license.\nIt's simple to download a pre-converted whisper model from [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)\nhere: https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp. There are a number of options, but we recommend to start with `ggml-small.bin`.\n\nThe recommended model can be downloaded using the code snippet below:\n\n```bash\ncd ../../../models\ncurl -sLO https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-small.bin\ncd ../recipes/audio/audio_to_text\n```\n\n_A full list of supported open models is forthcoming._\n\n\n## Build the Model Service\n\nThe complete instructions for building and deploying the Model Service can be found in the [whispercpp model-service document](../../../model_servers/whispercpp/README.md).\n\n```bash\n# from path model_servers/whispercpp from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes\nmake build\n```\nCheckout the [Makefile](../../../model_servers/whispercpp/Makefile) to get more details on different options for how to build.\n\n## Deploy the Model Service\n\nThe local Model Service relies on a volume mount to the localhost to access the model files. It also employs environment variables to dictate the model used and where its served. You can start your local Model Service using the following `make` command from `model_servers/whispercpp` set with reasonable defaults:\n\n```bash\n# from path model_servers/whispercpp from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes\nmake run\n```\n\n## Build the AI Application\n\nNow that the Model Service is running we want to build and deploy our AI Application. Use the provided Containerfile to build the AI Application\nimage from the [`audio-to-text/`](./) directory.\n\n```bash\n# from path recipes/audio/audio_to_text from repo containers/ai-lab-recipes\npodman build -t audio-to-text app\n```\n### Deploy the AI Application\n\nMake sure the Model Service is up and running before starting this container image.\nWhen starting the AI Application container image we need to direct it to the correct `MODEL_ENDPOINT`.\nThis could be any appropriately hosted Model Service (running locally or in the cloud) using a compatible API.\nThe following Podman command can be used to run your AI Application:\n\n```bash\npodman run --rm -it -p 8501:8501 -e MODEL_ENDPOINT=http://10.88.0.1:8001/inference audio-to-text \n```\n\n### Interact with the AI Application\n\nOnce the streamlit application is up and running, you should be able to access it at `http://localhost:8501`.\nFrom here, you can upload audio files from your local machine and translate the audio files as shown below.\n\nBy using this recipe and getting this starting point established,\nusers should now have an easier time customizing and building their own AI enabled applications.\n\n#### Input audio files\n\nWhisper.cpp requires as an input 16-bit WAV audio files.\nTo convert your input audio files to 16-bit WAV format you can use `ffmpeg` like this:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i <input.mp3> -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le <output.wav>\n```\n",

Check out [`gpt-oss-120b`](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b) for the larger model.\r\n\r\n# Highlights\r\n\r\n* **Permissive Apache 2.0 license:** Build freely without copyleft restrictions or patent risk—ideal for experimentation, customization, and commercial deployment.\r\n* **Configurable reasoning effort:** Easily adjust the reasoning effort (low, medium, high) based on your specific use case and latency needs.\r\n* **Full chain-of-thought:** Gain complete access to the model’s reasoning process, facilitating easier debugging and increased trust in outputs. It’s not intended to be shown to end users.\r\n* **Fine-tunable:** Fully customize models to your specific use case through parameter fine-tuning.\r\n* **Agentic capabilities:** Use the models’ native capabilities for function calling, [web browsing](https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#browser), [Python code execution](https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#python), and Structured Outputs.\r\n* **Native MXFP4 quantization:** The models are trained with native MXFP4 precision for the MoE layer, making `gpt-oss-120b` run on a single H100 GPU and the `gpt-oss-20b` model run within 16GB of memory.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Inference examples\r\n\r\n## Transformers\r\nYou can use `gpt-oss-120b` and `gpt-oss-20b` with Transformers.

Built upon extensive training, Qwen3 delivers groundbreaking advancements in reasoning, instruction-following, agent capabilities, and multilingual support, with the following key features:\r\n\r\n- **Uniquely support of seamless switching between thinking mode** (for complex logical reasoning, math, and coding) and **non-thinking mode** (for efficient, general-purpose dialogue) **within single model**, ensuring optimal performance across various scenarios.\r\n- **Significantly enhancement in its reasoning capabilities**, surpassing previous QwQ (in thinking mode) and Qwen2.5 instruct models (in non-thinking mode) on mathematics, code generation, and commonsense logical reasoning.\r\n- **Superior human preference alignment**, excelling in creative writing, role-playing, multi-turn dialogues, and instruction following, to deliver a more natural, engaging, and immersive conversational experience.\r\n- **Expertise in agent capabilities**, enabling precise integration with external tools in both thinking and unthinking modes and achieving leading performance among open-source models in complex agent-based tasks.\r\n- **Support of 100+ languages and dialects** with strong capabilities for **multilingual instruction following** and **translation**.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Model Overview\r\n\r\n**Qwen3-4B** has the following features:\r\n- Type: Causal Language Models\r\n- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\r\n- Number of Parameters: 4.0B\r\n- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 3.6B\r\n- Number of Layers: 36\r\n- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 32 for Q and 8 for KV\r\n- Context Length: 32,768 natively and [131,072 tokens with YaRN](#processing-long-texts).\r\n\r\n- Quantization: q4_K_M, q5_0, q5_K_M, q6_K, q8_0\r\n\r\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our [blog](https:\/\/qwenlm.github.io\/blog\/qwen3\/), [GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/QwenLM\/Qwen3), and [Documentation](https:\/\/qwen.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/).\r\n\r\n## Quickstart\r\n\r\n### llama.cpp\r\n\r\nCheck out our [llama.cpp documentation](https:\/\/qwen.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/run_locally\/llama.cpp.html) for more usage guide.\r\n\r\nWe advise you to clone [`llama.cpp`](https:\/\/github.com\/ggerganov\/llama.cpp) and install it following the official guide. We follow the latest version of llama.cpp. \r\nIn the following demonstration, we assume that you are running commands under the repository `llama.cpp`.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n.\/llama-cli -hf Qwen\/Qwen3-4B-GGUF:Q8_0 --jinja --color -ngl 99 -fa -sm row --temp 0.6 --top-k 20 --top-p 0.95 --min-p 0 --presence-penalty 1.5 -c 40960 -n 32768 --no-context-shift\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ollama\r\n\r\nCheck out our [ollama documentation](https:\/\/qwen.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/run_locally\/ollama.html) for more usage guide.\r\n\r\nYou can run Qwen3 with one command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nollama run hf.co\/Qwen\/Qwen3-4B-GGUF:Q8_0\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Mode\r\n\r\nYou can add `\/think` and `\/no_think` to user prompts or system messages to switch the model's thinking mode from turn to turn. The model will follow the most recent instruction in multi-turn conversations.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of multi-turn conversation:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> Who are you \/no_think\r\n\r\n<think>\r\n\r\n<\/think>\r\n\r\nI am Qwen, a large-scale language model developed by Alibaba Cloud. [...]\r\n\r\n> How many 'r's are in 'strawberries'? \/think\r\n\r\n<think>\r\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking how many times the letter 'r' appears in the word \"strawberries\". [...]\r\n<\/think>\r\n\r\nThe word strawberries contains 3 instances of the letter r. [...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Processing Long Texts\r\n\r\nQwen3 natively supports context lengths of up to 32,768 tokens. For conversations where the total length (including both input and output) significantly exceeds this limit, we recommend using RoPE scaling techniques to handle long texts effectively. We have validated the model's performance on context lengths of up to 131,072 tokens using the [YaRN](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2309.00071) method.\r\n\r\nTo enable YARN in ``llama.cpp``:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n.\/llama-cli ... -c 131072 --rope-scaling yarn --rope-scale 4 --yarn-orig-ctx 32768\r\n```\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> All the notable open-source frameworks implement static YaRN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts.**\r\n> We advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required. \r\n> It is also recommended to modify the `factor` as needed. For example, if the typical context length for your application is 65,536 tokens, it would be better to set `factor` as 2.0. \r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> The endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio supports dynamic YaRN by default and no extra configuration is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Best Practices\r\n\r\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\r\n\r\n1. **Sampling Parameters**:\r\n   - For thinking mode (`enable_thinking=True`), use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, `MinP=0`, and `PresencePenalty=1.5`. **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions.\r\n   - For non-thinking mode (`enable_thinking=False`), we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, `MinP=0`, and `PresencePenalty=1.5`.\r\n   - **We recommend setting `presence_penalty` to 1.5 for quantized models to suppress repetitive outputs.** You can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2. A higher value may occasionally lead to language mixing and a slight reduction in model performance. \r\n\r\n2. **Adequate Output Length**: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 38,912 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\r\n\r\n3. **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\r\n   - **Math Problems**: Include \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" in the prompt.\r\n   - **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: \"Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g., `\"answer\": \"C\"`.\"\r\n\r\n4. **No Thinking Content in History**: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.\r\n\r\n### Citation\r\n\r\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\r\n      title={Qwen3 Technical Report}, \r\n      author={Qwen Team},\r\n      year={2025},\r\n      eprint={2505.09388},\r\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\r\n      primaryClass={cs.CL},\r\n      url={https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2505.09388}, \r\n}\r\n```",

We are pleased to introduce **Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507**, featuring the following key enhancements:\n\n- **Significantly improved performance** on reasoning tasks, including logical reasoning, mathematics, science, coding, and academic benchmarks that typically require human expertise.\n- **Markedly better general capabilities**, such as instruction following, tool usage, text generation, and alignment with human preferences.\n- **Enhanced 256K long-context understanding** capabilities.\n\n**NOTE**: This version has an increased thinking length. We strongly recommend its use in highly complex reasoning tasks.\n\n![image/jpeg](https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/Qwen3-2507/Qwen3-4B-Instruct.001.jpeg)\n\n## Model Overview\n\n**Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507** has the following features:\n- Type: Causal Language Models\n- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\n- Number of Parameters: 4.0B\n- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 3.6B\n- Number of Layers: 36\n- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 32 for Q and 8 for KV\n- Context Length: **262,144 natively**. \n\n**NOTE: This model supports only thinking mode. Meanwhile, specifying `enable_thinking=True` is no longer required.**\n\nAdditionally, to enforce model thinking, the default chat template automatically includes `<think>`. Therefore, it is normal for the model's output to contain only `</think>` without an explicit opening `<think>` tag.\n\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n\n## Performance\n\n\n|  | Qwen3-30B-A3B Thinking | Qwen3-4B Thinking | Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 |\n|--- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Knowledge** | | |\n| MMLU-Pro | **78.5** | 70.4 | 74.0 |\n| MMLU-Redux | **89.5** | 83.7 | 86.1 |\n| GPQA | **65.8** | 55.9 | **65.8** |\n| SuperGPQA | **51.8** | 42.7 | 47.8 |\n| **Reasoning** | | |\n| AIME25 | 70.9 | 65.6 | **81.3** |\n| HMMT25 | 49.8 | 42.1 | **55.5** |\n| LiveBench 20241125 | **74.3** | 63.6 | 71.8 |\n| **Coding** | | |\n| LiveCodeBench v6 (25.02-25.05) | **57.4** | 48.4 | 55.2 |\n| CFEval | **1940** | 1671 | 1852 |\n| OJBench | **20.7** | 16.1 | 17.9 |\n| **Alignment** | | |\n| IFEval | 86.5 | 81.9 | **87.4** |\n| Arena-Hard v2$ | **36.3** | 13.7 | 34.9 |\n| Creative Writing v3 | **79.1** | 61.1 | 75.6 |\n| WritingBench | 77.0 | 73.5 | **83.3** |\n| **Agent** | | |\n| BFCL-v3 | 69.1 | 65.9 | **71.2** |\n| TAU1-Retail | 61.7 | 33.9 | **66.1** |\n| TAU1-Airline | 32.0 | 32.0 | **48.0** |\n| TAU2-Retail | 34.2 | 38.6 | **53.5** |\n| TAU2-Airline | 36.0 | 28.0 | **58.0** |\n| TAU2-Telecom | 22.8 | 17.5 | **27.2** |\n| **Multilingualism** | | |\n| MultiIF | 72.2 | 66.3 | **77.3** |\n| MMLU-ProX | **73.1** | 61.0 | 64.2 |\n| INCLUDE | **71.9** | 61.8 | 64.4 |\n| PolyMATH | 46.1 | 40.0 | **46.2** |\n\n$ For reproducibility, we report the win rates evaluated by GPT-4.1.\n\n\\& For highly challenging tasks (including PolyMATH and all reasoning and coding tasks), we use an output length of 81,920 tokens. For all other tasks, we set the output length to 32,768.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nThe code of Qwen3 has been in the latest Hugging Face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.\n\nWith `transformers<4.51.0`, you will encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: 'qwen3'\n```\n\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs. \n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = \"Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507\"\n\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype=\"auto\",\n    device_map=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = \"Give me a short introduction to large language model.\"\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=32768\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() \n\n# parsing thinking content\ntry:\n    # rindex finding 151668 (</think>)\n    index = len(output_ids) - output_ids[::-1].index(151668)\nexcept ValueError:\n    index = 0\n\nthinking_content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[:index], skip_special_tokens=True).strip(\"\\n\")\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[index:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip(\"\\n\")\n\nprint(\"thinking content:\", thinking_content) # no opening <think> tag\nprint(\"content:\", content)\n\n```\n\nFor deployment, you can use `sglang>=0.4.6.post1` or `vllm>=0.8.5` or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:\n- SGLang:\n    ```shell\n    python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 --context-length 262144  --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1\n    ```\n- vLLM:\n    ```shell\n    vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 --max-model-len 262144 --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1\n    ```\n\n**Note: If you encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues, you may consider reducing the context length to a smaller value. However, since the model may require longer token sequences for reasoning, we strongly recommend using a context length greater than 131,072 when possible.**\n\nFor local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.\n\n## Agentic Use\n\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent) to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\n\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\n```python\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n\n# Define LLM\n# Using OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. It is recommended to disable the reasoning and the tool call parsing\n# functionality of the deployment frameworks and let Qwen-Agent automate the related operations. For example, \n# `VLLM_USE_MODELSCOPE=true vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 --served-model-name Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 --max-model-len 262144`.\nllm_cfg = {\n    'model': 'Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507',\n\n    # Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API:\n    'model_server': 'http://localhost:8000/v1',  # api_base without reasoning and tool call parsing\n    'api_key': 'EMPTY',\n    'generate_cfg': {\n        'thought_in_content': True,\n    },\n}\n\n# Define Tools\ntools = [\n    {'mcpServers': {  # You can specify the MCP configuration file\n            'time': {\n                'command': 'uvx',\n                'args': ['mcp-server-time', '--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai']\n            },\n            \"fetch\": {\n                \"command\": \"uvx\",\n                \"args\": [\"mcp-server-fetch\"]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n  'code_interpreter',  # Built-in tools\n]\n\n# Define Agent\nbot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)\n\n# Streaming generation\nmessages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/ Introduce the latest developments of Qwen'}]\nfor responses in bot.run(messages=messages):\n    pass\nprint(responses)\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\n\n1. **Sampling Parameters**:\n   - We suggest using `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`.\n   - For supported frameworks, you can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\n\n2. **Adequate Output Length**: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 81,920 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\n\n3. **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\n   - **Math Problems**: Include \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" in the prompt.\n   - **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: \"Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g., `\"answer\": \"C\"`.\"\n\n4. **No Thinking Content in History**: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content.

This model is developed using a diverse set of techniques with a structured chat format, including supervised finetuning, model alignment using reinforcement learning, and model merging. Granite 4.0 instruct models feature improved *instruction following (IF)* and *tool-calling* capabilities, making them more effective in enterprise applications.\n\n- **Developers:** Granite Team, IBM\n- **HF Collection:** [Granite 4.0 Language Models HF Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/ibm-granite/granite-40-language-models-6811a18b820ef362d9e5a82c)\n- **GitHub Repository:** [ibm-granite/granite-4.0-language-models](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-4.0-language-models)\n- **Website**: [Granite Docs](https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/) \n- **Release Date**: October 2nd, 2025\n- **License:** [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\n**Supported Languages:** \nEnglish, German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Portuguese, Arabic, Czech, Italian, Korean, Dutch, and Chinese. Users may finetune Granite 4.0 models for languages beyond these languages.\n\n**Intended use:** \nThe model is designed to respond to general instructions and can be used to build AI assistants for multiple domains, including business applications.\n\n*Capabilities*\n* Summarization\n* Text classification\n* Text extraction\n* Question-answering\n* Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n* Code related tasks\n* Function-calling tasks\n* Multilingual dialog use cases\n* Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM) code completions\n\n<!-- <todo>Need to test the examples. (especially the tool calling and RAG ones)</todo>\n -->\n \n**Generation:** \nThis is a simple example of how to use Granite-4.0-H-Tiny model.\n\nInstall the following libraries:\n\n```shell\npip install torch torchvision torchaudio\npip install accelerate\npip install transformers\n```\nThen, copy the snippet from the section that is relevant for your use case.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\ndevice = \"cuda\"\nmodel_path = \"ibm-granite/granite-4.0-h-tiny\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)\n# drop device_map if running on CPU\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, device_map=device)\nmodel.eval()\n# change input text as desired\nchat = [\n    { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please list one IBM Research laboratory located in the United States. You should only output its name and location.\" },\n]\nchat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)\n# tokenize the text\ninput_tokens = tokenizer(chat, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device)\n# generate output tokens\noutput = model.generate(**input_tokens, \n                        max_new_tokens=100)\n# decode output tokens into text\noutput = tokenizer.batch_decode(output)\n# print output\nprint(output[0])\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```shell\n<|start_of_role|>user<|end_of_role|>Please list one IBM Research laboratory located in the United States. You should only output its name and location.<|end_of_text|>\n<|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|>Almaden Research Center, San Jose, California<|end_of_text|>\n```\n\n**Tool-calling:** \nGranite-4.0-H-Tiny comes with enhanced tool calling capabilities, enabling seamless integration with external functions and APIs. To define a list of  tools please follow OpenAI's function [definition schema](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling?api-mode=responses#defining-functions). \n\nThis is an example of how to use Granite-4.0-H-Tiny model tool-calling ability:\n\n```python\ntools = [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"function\",\n        \"function\": {\n            \"name\": \"get_current_weather\",\n            \"description\": \"Get the current weather for a specified city.\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"city\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                        \"description\": \"Name of the city\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"city\"]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n]\n\n# change input text as desired\nchat = [\n    { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the weather like in Boston right now?\" },\n]\nchat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, \\\n                                     tokenize=False, \\\n                                     tools=tools, \\\n                                     add_generation_prompt=True)\n# tokenize the text\ninput_tokens = tokenizer(chat, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device)\n# generate output tokens\noutput = model.generate(**input_tokens, \n                        max_new_tokens=100)\n# decode output tokens into text\noutput = tokenizer.batch_decode(output)\n# print output\nprint(output[0])\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```shell\n<|start_of_role|>system<|end_of_role|>You are a helpful assistant with access to the following tools. You may call one or more tools to assist with the user query.\n\nYou are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:\n<tools>\n{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"get_current_weather\", \"description\": \"Get the current weather for a specified city.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"city\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Name of the city\"}}, \"required\": [\"city\"]}}}\n</tools>\n\nFor each tool call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": <function-name>, \"arguments\": <args-json-object>}\n</tool_call>. If a tool does not exist in the provided list of tools, notify the user that you do not have the ability to fulfill the request.<|end_of_text|>\n<|start_of_role|>user<|end_of_role|>What's the weather like in Boston right now?<|end_of_text|>\n<|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|><tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"get_current_weather\", \"arguments\": {\"city\": \"Boston\"}}\n</tool_call><|end_of_text|>\n```\n\n<!-- **Retrieval Augmented Generation:** \n*Coming soon* -->\n\n**Evaluation Results:** \n\n<table>\n<!--   <caption><b> All Results</b></caption> -->\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th style=\"text-align:left;

Intra-rack communication occurs via the 72-GPU NVLink domain, and a non-blocking, full Fat-Tree NDR 400 Gb/s InfiniBand network provides inter-rack communication. This cluster provides a scalable and efficient infrastructure for training our models over thousands of GPUs.\n\n**Ethical Considerations and Limitations:** \nGranite 4.0 Instruction Models are primarily finetuned using instruction-response pairs mostly in English, but also multilingual data covering multiple languages. Although this model can handle multilingual dialog use cases, its performance might not be similar to English tasks. In such case, introducing a small number of examples (few-shot) can help the model in generating more accurate outputs. While this model has been aligned by keeping safety in consideration, the model may in some cases produce inaccurate, biased, or unsafe responses to user prompts. So we urge the community to use this model with proper safety testing and tuning tailored for their specific tasks.\n\n**Resources**\n- ⭐\uFE0F Learn about the latest updates with Granite: https://www.ibm.com/granite\n- \uD83D\uDCC4 Get started with tutorials, best practices, and prompt engineering advice: https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/\n- \uD83D\uDCA1 Learn about the latest Granite learning resources: https://ibm.biz/granite-learning-resources\n\n<!-- ## Citation\n```\n@misc{granite-models,\n  author = {author 1, author2, ...},\n  title = {},\n  journal = {},\n  volume = {},\n  year = {2024},\n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/0000.00000},\n}\n``` -->",

It was introduced in the paper [End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872) by Carion et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr). \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing DETR did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nThe DETR model is an encoder-decoder transformer with a convolutional backbone. Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. \n\nThe model is trained using a \"bipartite matching loss\": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a \"no object\" as class and \"no bounding box\" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.\n\n![model image](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/detr_architecture.png)\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for object detection.

It is not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. \nDevelopers should consider common limitations of language models, as well as performance difference across languages, as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. \nDevelopers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including but not limited to privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. \n \n***Nothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.***\n \n## Release Notes\n \nThis release of Phi-4-mini-reasoning addresses user feedback and market demand for a compact reasoning model. \nIt is a compact transformer-based language model optimized for mathematical reasoning, built to deliver high-quality, step-by-step problem solving in environments where computing or latency is constrained.\nThe model is fine-tuned with synthetic math data from a more capable model (much larger, smarter, more accurate, and better at following instructions), which has resulted in enhanced reasoning performance. \nPhi-4-mini-reasoning balances reasoning ability with efficiency, making it potentially suitable for educational applications, embedded tutoring, and lightweight deployment on edge or mobile systems.\nIf a critical issue is identified with Phi-4-mini-reasoning, it should be promptly reported through the MSRC Researcher Portal or secure@microsoft.com  \n \n### Model Quality\n \nTo understand the capabilities, the 3.8B parameters Phi-4-mini-reasoning model was compared with a set of models over a variety of reasoning benchmarks. \nA high-level overview of the model quality is as follows:\n\n| Model                              | AIME  | MATH-500 | GPQA Diamond |\n|------------------------------------|-------|----------|--------------|\n| o1-mini*                           | 63.6  | 90.0     | 60.0         |\n| DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B        | 53.3  | 91.4     | 49.5         |\n| DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B       | 43.3  | 86.9     | 47.3         |\n| Bespoke-Stratos-7B*                | 20.0  | 82.0     | 37.8         |\n| OpenThinker-7B*                    | 31.3  | 83.0     | 42.4         |\n| Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct              | 6.7   | 44.4     | 25.3         |\n| Phi-4-Mini (base model, 3.8B)      | 10.0  | 71.8     | 36.9         |\n|**Phi-4-mini-reasoning (3.8B)**     | **57.5** | **94.6** | **52.0**  |\n \nOverall, the model with only 3.8B-param achieves a similar level of multilingual language understanding and reasoning ability as much larger models.\nHowever, it is still fundamentally limited by its size for certain tasks. The model simply does not have the capacity to store too much factual knowledge, therefore, users may experience factual incorrectness. However, it may be possible to resolve such weakness by augmenting Phi-4 with a search engine, particularly when using the model under RAG settings.\n \n## Usage\n \n### Tokenizer\n \nPhi-4-mini-reasoning supports a vocabulary size of up to `200064` tokens. The [tokenizer files](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-4-mini-reasoning/blob/main/added_tokens.json) already provide placeholder tokens that can be used for downstream fine-tuning, but they can also be extended up to the model's vocabulary size.\n \n### Input Formats\n \nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-4-mini-instruct\nmodel is best suited for prompts using specific formats.\nBelow are the two primary formats:\n \n#### Chat format\n \nThis format is used for general conversation and instructions:\n \n```yaml\n<|system|>Your name is Phi, an AI math expert developed by Microsoft.<|end|><|user|>How to solve 3*x^2+4*x+5=1?<|end|><|assistant|>\n```\n### Inference with transformers\n\nPhi-4-mini-reasoning has been integrated in the `4.51.3` version of `transformers`. The current `transformers` version can be verified with: `pip list | grep transformers`.\nPython 3.8 and 3.10 will work best. \nList of required packages:\n\n```\nflash_attn==2.7.4.post1\ntorch==2.5.1\ntransformers==4.51.3\naccelerate==1.3.0\n```\n \nPhi-4-mini-reasoning is also available in [Azure AI Studio](https://aka.ms/phi-4-mini-reasoning/azure)\n\n#### Example\n \nAfter obtaining the Phi-4-mini-instruct model checkpoints, users can use this sample code for inference.\n \n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline\ntorch.random.manual_seed(0)\n\nmodel_id = \"microsoft/Phi-4-mini-reasoning\"\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_id,\n    device_map=\"cuda\",\n    torch_dtype=\"auto\",\n    trust_remote_code=True,\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\n\nmessages = [{\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"How to solve 3*x^2+4*x+5=1?\"\n}]   \ninputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    return_dict=True,\n    return_tensors=\"pt\",\n)\n\noutputs = model.generate(\n    **inputs.to(model.device),\n    max_new_tokens=32768,\n    temperature=0.8,\n    top_p=0.95,\n    do_sample=True,\n)\noutputs = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs[:, inputs[\"input_ids\"].shape[-1]:])\n\nprint(outputs[0])\n```\n \n## Training\n \n### Model\n \n+ **Architecture:** Phi-4-mini-reasoning shares the same architecture as Phi-4-Mini, which has 3.8B parameters and is a dense decoder-only Transformer model. When compared with Phi-3.5-Mini, the major changes with Phi-4-Mini are 200K vocabulary, grouped-query attention, and shared input and output embedding.<br>\n+ **Inputs:** Text. It is best suited for prompts using the chat format.<br>\n+ **Context length:** 128K tokens<br>\n+ **GPUs:** 128 H100-80G<br>\n+ **Training time:** 2 days<br>\n+ **Training data:** 150B tokens<br>\n+ **Outputs:** Generated text<br>\n+ **Dates:** Trained in February 2024<br>\n+ **Status:** This is a static model trained on offline datasets with the cutoff date of February 2025 for publicly available data.<br>\n+ **Supported languages:** English<br>\n+ **Release date:** April 2025<br>\n \n### Training Datasets\n \nThe training data for Phi-4-mini-reasoning consists exclusively of synthetic mathematical content generated by a stronger and more advanced reasoning model, Deepseek-R1. \nThe objective is to distill knowledge from this model. This synthetic dataset comprises over one million diverse math problems spanning multiple levels of difficulty (from middle school to Ph.D. level).\nFor each problem in the synthetic dataset, eight distinct solutions (rollouts) were sampled, and only those verified as correct were retained, resulting in approximately 30 billion tokens of math content.\nThe dataset  integrates three primary components: \n1) a curated selection of high-quality, publicly available math questions and a part of the SFT(Supervised Fine-Tuning) data that was used to train the base Phi-4-Mini model;\n2) an extensive collection of synthetic math data generated by the Deepseek-R1 model, designed specifically for high-quality supervised fine-tuning and model distillation; and\n3) a balanced set of correct and incorrect answers used to construct preference data aimed at enhancing Phi-4-mini-reasoning's reasoning capabilities by learning more effective reasoning trajectories\n\n## Software\n* [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)\n* [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)\n* [Flash-Attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention)\n \n## Hardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-4-mini-reasoning model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run. We have tested on the following GPU types:\n* NVIDIA A100\n* NVIDIA H100\n \nIf you want to run the model on:\n* NVIDIA V100 or earlier generation GPUs: call AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained() with attn_implementation=\"eager\"\n\n## Safety Evaluation and Red-Teaming\n \nThe Phi-4 family of models has adopted a robust safety post-training approach. This approach leverages a variety of both open-source and in-house generated datasets. The overall technique employed to do the safety alignment is a combination of SFT, DPO (Direct Preference Optimization), and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) approaches  by utilizing human-labeled and synthetic English-language datasets, including publicly available datasets focusing on helpfulness and harmlessness, as well as various questions and answers targeted to multiple safety categories. \n\nPhi-4-Mini-Reasoning was developed in accordance with Microsoft's responsible AI principles. Potential safety risks in the model’s responses were assessed using the Azure AI Foundry’s Risk and Safety Evaluation framework, focusing on harmful content, direct jailbreak, and model groundedness. The Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning Model Card contains additional information about our approach to safety and responsible AI considerations that developers should be aware of when using this model.\n\n## Responsible AI Considerations\n \nLike other language models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include:\n \n+ Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text and some additional multilingual text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance as well as performance disparities across non-English. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English.  \n+ Multilingual performance and safety gaps: We believe it is important to make language models more widely available across different languages, but the Phi 4 models still exhibit challenges common across multilingual releases. As with any deployment of LLMs, developers will be better positioned to test for performance or safety gaps for their linguistic and cultural context and customize the model with additional fine-tuning and appropriate safeguards.\n+ Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups, cultural contexts, or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases.\n+ Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the case.\n+ Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated.  \n+\tElection Information Reliability : The model has an elevated defect rate when responding to election-critical queries, which may result in incorrect or unauthoritative election critical information being presented. We are working to improve the model's performance in this area. Users should verify information related to elections with the election authority in their region.\n+ Limited Scope for Code: The majority of Phi 4 training data is based in Python and uses common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, it is  strongly recommended that users manually verify all API uses.\n+ Long Conversation: Phi 4 models, like other models, can in some cases generate responses that are repetitive, unhelpful, or inconsistent in very long chat sessions in both English and non-English languages. Developers are encouraged to place appropriate mitigations, like limiting conversation turns to account for the possible conversational drift.\n \nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices, including mapping, measuring, and mitigating risks associated with their specific use case and cultural, linguistic context. Phi 4 family of models are general purpose models. As developers plan to deploy these models for specific use cases, they are encouraged to fine-tune the models for their use case and leverage the models as part of broader AI systems with language-specific safeguards in place. Important areas for consideration include:  \n \n+ Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\n+ High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess the suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\n+ Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).  \n+ Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\n+ Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\n \n## License\nThe model is licensed under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).\n \n## Trademarks\nThis project may contain trademarks or logos for projects, products, or services.

In an ideal world, we would never change any prompts in our benchmarks to ensure it is always an apples-to-apples comparison when comparing different models. Indeed, this is our default approach, and is the case in the vast majority of models we have run to date. For all benchmarks, we consider using the same generation configuration such as max sequence length (32768), the same temperature for the fair comparison.\nBenchmark datasets\nWe evaluate the model with three of the most popular math benchmarks where the strongest reasoning models are competing together. Specifically:\n-\tMath-500: This benchmark consists of 500 challenging math problems designed to test the model's ability to perform complex mathematical reasoning and problem-solving.\n-\tAIME 2024: The American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) is a highly regarded math competition that features a series of difficult problems aimed at assessing advanced mathematical skills and logical reasoning.\n-\tGPQA Diamond: The Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A (GPQA) Diamond benchmark focuses on evaluating the model's ability to understand and solve a wide range of mathematical questions, including both straightforward calculations and more intricate problem-solving tasks.",

Phi-4-reasoning-plus has been trained additionally with Reinforcement Learning, hence, it has higher accuracy but generates on average 50% more tokens, thus having higher latency.                                                                  |\n| **Architecture**        | Base model same as previously released Phi-4, 14B parameters, dense decoder-only Transformer model                                                                                                     |\n| **Inputs**              | Text, best suited for prompts in the chat format                              |\n| **Context length**      | 32k tokens                                                                    |\n| **GPUs**                | 32 H100-80G                                                                   |\n| **Training time**       | 2.5 days                                                                      |\n| **Training data**       | 16B tokens, ~8.3B unique tokens                                               |\n| **Outputs**             | Generated text in response to the input.

Reasoning and logic.                                                                                                    |\n| **Out-of-Scope Use Cases**    | This model is designed and tested for math reasoning only. Our models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. Developers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case, including the model’s focus on English.

Nothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.                                                                                                     |\n\n## Usage\n\n> \n > To fully take advantage of the model's capabilities, inference must use `temperature=0.8`, `top_k=50`, `top_p=0.95`, and `do_sample=True`. For more complex queries, set `max_new_tokens=32768` to allow for longer chain-of-thought (CoT).\n *Phi-4-reasoning-plus has shown strong performance on reasoning-intensive tasks. In our experiments, we extended its maximum number of tokens to 64k, and it handled longer sequences with promising results, maintaining coherence and logical consistency over extended inputs. This makes it a compelling option to explore for tasks that require deep, multi-step reasoning or extensive context.*\n### Input Formats\nGiven the nature of the training data, **always use** ChatML template with the **following system prompt** for inference:\n```bash\n<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>\nYou are Phi, a language model trained by Microsoft to help users.

The chat prompts are sourced from filtered high-quality web data and optionally rewritten and processed through a synthetic data generation pipeline. We further include data to improve truthfulness and safety.\n\n### Benchmark Datasets\n\nWe evaluated Phi-4-reasoning-plus using the open-source [Eureka](https://github.com/microsoft/eureka-ml-insights) evaluation suite and our own internal benchmarks to understand the model's capabilities. More specifically, we evaluate our model on:\n\nReasoning tasks:\n\n* **AIME 2025, 2024, 2023, and 2022:** Math olympiad questions.\n\n* **GPQA-Diamond:** Complex, graduate-level science questions.\n\n* **OmniMath:** Collection of over 4000 olympiad-level math problems with human annotation.\n\n* **LiveCodeBench:** Code generation benchmark gathered from competitive coding contests.\n\n* **3SAT (3-literal Satisfiability Problem) and TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem):** Algorithmic problem solving.\n\n* **BA Calendar:** Planning.\n\n* **Maze and SpatialMap:** Spatial understanding.\n\nGeneral-purpose benchmarks:\n\n* **Kitab:** Information retrieval.\n\n* **IFEval and ArenaHard:** Instruction following.\n\n* **PhiBench:** Internal benchmark.\n\n* **FlenQA:** Impact of prompt length on model performance.\n\n* **HumanEvalPlus:** Functional code generation.\n\n* **MMLU-Pro:** Popular aggregated dataset for multitask language understanding.\n\n## Safety\n\n### Approach\n\nPhi-4-reasoning-plus has adopted a robust safety post-training approach via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This approach leverages a variety of both open-source and in-house generated synthetic prompts, with LLM-generated responses that adhere to rigorous Microsoft safety guidelines, e.g., User Understanding and Clarity, Security and Ethical Guidelines, Limitations, Disclaimers and Knowledge Scope, Handling Complex and Sensitive Topics, Safety and Respectful Engagement, Confidentiality of Guidelines and Confidentiality of Chain-of-Thoughts. \n\n### Safety Evaluation and Red-Teaming\n\nPrior to release, Phi-4-reasoning-plus followed a multi-faceted evaluation approach. Quantitative evaluation was conducted with multiple open-source safety benchmarks and in-house tools utilizing adversarial conversation simulation. For qualitative safety evaluation, we collaborated with the independent AI Red Team (AIRT) at Microsoft to assess safety risks posed by Phi-4-reasoning-plus in both average and adversarial user scenarios. In the average user scenario, AIRT emulated typical single-turn and multi-turn interactions to identify potentially risky behaviors. The adversarial user scenario tested a wide range of techniques aimed at intentionally subverting the model's safety training including grounded-ness, jailbreaks, harmful content like hate and unfairness, violence, sexual content, or self-harm, and copyright violations for protected material. We further evaluate models on Toxigen, a benchmark designed to measure bias and toxicity targeted towards minority groups. \n\nPlease refer to the technical report for more details on safety alignment. \n\n## Model Quality\n\nAt the high-level overview of the model quality on representative benchmarks.

We also test the models on multiple new reasoning benchmarks for algorithmic problem solving and planning, including 3SAT, TSP, and BA-Calendar. These new tasks are nominally out-of-domain for the models as the training process did not intentionally target these skills, but the models still show strong generalization to these tasks. Furthermore, when evaluating performance against standard general abilities benchmarks such as instruction following or non-reasoning tasks, we find that our new models improve significantly from Phi-4, despite the post-training being focused on reasoning skills in specific domains. \n\n## Responsible AI Considerations\n\nLike other language models, Phi-4-reasoning-plus can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include:   \n\n* **Quality of Service:** The model is trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English. Phi-4-reasoning-plus is not intended to support multilingual use. \n\n* **Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes:** These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases.  \n\n* **Inappropriate or Offensive Content:** These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case.  \n\n* **Information Reliability:** Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated.\n\n* **Election Information Reliability:** The model has an elevated defect rate when responding to election-critical queries, which may result in incorrect or unauthoritative election critical information being presented. We are working to improve the model's performance in this area. Users should verify information related to elections with the election authority in their region. \n\n* **Limited Scope for Code:** Majority of Phi-4-reasoning-plus training data is based in Python and uses common packages such as `typing`, `math`, `random`, `collections`, `datetime`, `itertools`. If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.  \n\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Using safety services like [Azure AI Content Safety](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-content-safety) that have advanced guardrails is highly recommended. Important areas for consideration include:\n\n* **Allocation:** Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques. \n\n* **High-Risk Scenarios:** Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.  \n\n* **Misinformation:** Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).    \n\n* **Generation of Harmful Content:** Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.  \n\n* **Misuse:** Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\n",

These models were trained with data in over 140\nspoken languages.\n\nGemma 3n models use selective parameter activation technology to reduce resource\nrequirements. This technique allows the models to operate at an effective size\nof 2B and 4B parameters, which is lower than the total number of parameters they\ncontain. For more information on Gemma 3n's efficient parameter management\ntechnology, see the\n[Gemma 3n](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/gemma-3n#parameters)\npage.\n\n### Inputs and outputs\n\n-   **Input:**\n    -   Text string, such as a question, a prompt, or a document to be\n        summarized\n    -   Images, normalized to 256x256, 512x512, or 768x768 resolution\n        and encoded to 256 tokens each\n    -   Audio data encoded to 6.25 tokens per second from a single channel\n    -   Total input context of 32K tokens\n-   **Output:**\n    -   Generated text in response to the input, such as an answer to a\n        question, analysis of image content, or a summary of a document\n    -   Total output length up to 32K tokens, subtracting the request\n        input tokens\n\n### Usage\n\nBelow, there are some code snippets on how to get quickly started with running\nthe model. First, install the Transformers library. Gemma 3n is supported\nstarting from transformers 4.53.0.\n\n```sh\n$ pip install -U transformers\n```\n\nThen, copy the snippet from the section that is relevant for your use case.\n\n#### Running with the `pipeline` API\n\nYou can initialize the model and processor for inference with `pipeline` as\nfollows.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nimport torch\n\npipe = pipeline(\n    \"image-text-to-text\",\n    model=\"google/gemma-3n-e4b-it\",\n    device=\"cuda\",\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n)\n```\n\nWith instruction-tuned models, you need to use chat templates to process our\ninputs first. Then, you can pass it to the pipeline.\n\n```python\nmessages = [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"system\",\n        \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}]\n    },\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": [\n            {\"type\": \"image\", \"url\": \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/p-blog/candy.JPG\"},\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What animal is on the candy?\"}\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\noutput = pipe(text=messages, max_new_tokens=200)\nprint(output[0][\"generated_text\"][-1][\"content\"])\n# Okay, let's take a look!\n# Based on the image, the animal on the candy is a **turtle**.\n# You can see the shell shape and the head and legs.\n```\n\n#### Running the model on a single GPU\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor, Gemma3nForConditionalGeneration\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\nimport torch\n\nmodel_id = \"google/gemma-3n-e4b-it\"\n\nmodel = Gemma3nForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"auto\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,).eval()\n\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\n\nmessages = [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"system\",\n        \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}]\n    },\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": [\n            {\"type\": \"image\", \"image\": \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/bee.jpg\"},\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this image in detail.\"}\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\ninputs = processor.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    tokenize=True,\n    return_dict=True,\n    return_tensors=\"pt\",\n).to(model.device)\n\ninput_len = inputs[\"input_ids\"].shape[-1]\n\nwith torch.inference_mode():\n    generation = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=False)\n    generation = generation[0][input_len:]\n\ndecoded = processor.decode(generation, skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(decoded)\n\n# **Overall Impression:** The image is a close-up shot of a vibrant garden scene,\n# focusing on a cluster of pink cosmos flowers and a busy bumblebee.\n# It has a slightly soft, natural feel, likely captured in daylight.\n```\n\n### Citation\n\n```\n@article{gemma_3n_2025,\n    title={Gemma 3n},\n    url={https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/gemma-3n},\n    publisher={Google DeepMind},\n    author={Gemma Team},\n    year={2025}\n}\n```\n\n## Model Data\n\nData used for model training and how the data was processed.\n\n### Training Dataset\n\nThese models were trained on a dataset that includes a wide variety of sources\ntotalling approximately 11 trillion tokens. The knowledge cutoff date for the\ntraining data was June 2024. Here are the key components:\n\n-   **Web Documents**: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model\n    is exposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary.\n    The training dataset includes content in over 140 languages.\n-   **Code**: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and\n    patterns of programming languages, which improves its ability to generate\n    code and understand code-related questions.\n-   **Mathematics**: Training on mathematical text helps the model learn\n    logical reasoning, symbolic representation, and to address mathematical queries.\n-   **Images**: A wide range of images enables the model to perform image\n    analysis and visual data extraction tasks.\n-   Audio: A diverse set of sound samples enables the model to recognize\n    speech, transcribe text from recordings, and identify information in audio data.\n\nThe combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a\npowerful multimodal model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks and\ndata formats.\n\n### Data Preprocessing\n\nHere are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training\ndata:\n\n-   **CSAM Filtering**: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material)\n    filtering was applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to\n    ensure the exclusion of harmful and illegal content.\n-   **Sensitive Data Filtering**: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models\n    safe and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain\n    personal information and other sensitive data from training sets.\n-   **Additional methods**: Filtering based on content quality and safety in\n    line with\n    [our policies](https://ai.google/static/documents/ai-responsibility-update-published-february-2025.pdf).\n\n## Implementation Information\n\nDetails about the model internals.\n\n### Hardware\n\nGemma was trained using [Tensor Processing Unit\n(TPU)](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/intro-to-tpu) hardware (TPUv4p, TPUv5p\nand TPUv5e). Training generative models requires significant computational\npower. TPUs, designed specifically for matrix operations common in machine\nlearning, offer several advantages in this domain:\n\n-   **Performance**: TPUs are specifically designed to handle the massive\n    computations involved in training generative models. They can speed up\n    training considerably compared to CPUs.\n-   **Memory**: TPUs often come with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,\n    allowing for the handling of large models and batch sizes during training.\n    This can lead to better model quality.\n-   **Scalability**: TPU Pods (large clusters of TPUs) provide a scalable\n    solution for handling the growing complexity of large foundation models.\n    You can distribute training across multiple TPU devices for faster and more\n    efficient processing.\n-   **Cost-effectiveness**: In many scenarios, TPUs can provide a more\n    cost-effective solution for training large models compared to CPU-based\n    infrastructure, especially when considering the time and resources saved\n    due to faster training.\n\nThese advantages are aligned with\n[Google's commitments to operate sustainably](https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/).\n\n### Software\n\nTraining was done using [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) and\n[ML Pathways](https://blog.google/technology/ai/introducing-pathways-next-generation-ai-architecture/).\nJAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,\nincluding TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models. ML\nPathways is Google's latest effort to build artificially intelligent systems\ncapable of generalizing across multiple tasks. This is specially suitable for\nfoundation models, including large language models like these ones.\n\nTogether, JAX and ML Pathways are used as described in the\n[paper about the Gemini family of models](https://goo.gle/gemma2report):\n*\"the 'single controller' programming model of Jax and Pathways allows a single\nPython process to orchestrate the entire training run, dramatically simplifying\nthe development workflow.\"*\n\n## Evaluation\n\nModel evaluation metrics and results.\n\n### Benchmark Results\n\nThese models were evaluated at full precision (float32) against a large\ncollection of different datasets and metrics to cover different aspects of\ncontent generation. Evaluation results marked with **IT** are for\ninstruction-tuned models. Evaluation results marked with **PT** are for\npre-trained models.\n\n#### Reasoning and factuality\n\n| Benchmark                      | Metric         | n-shot   |  E2B PT  |  E4B PT  |\n|

https://huggingface.co/datasets/CohereForAI/Global-MMLU-Lite\n\n## Ethics and Safety\n\nEthics and safety evaluation approach and results.\n\n### Evaluation Approach\n\nOur evaluation methods include structured evaluations and internal red-teaming\ntesting of relevant content policies. Red-teaming was conducted by a number of\ndifferent teams, each with different goals and human evaluation metrics. These\nmodels were evaluated against a number of different categories relevant to\nethics and safety, including:\n\n-   **Child Safety**: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\n    covering child safety policies, including child sexual abuse and\n    exploitation.\n-   **Content Safety:** Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\n    covering safety policies including, harassment, violence and gore, and hate\n    speech.\n-   **Representational Harms**: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text\n    prompts covering safety policies including bias, stereotyping, and harmful\n    associations or inaccuracies.\n\nIn addition to development level evaluations, we conduct \"assurance\nevaluations\" which are our 'arms-length' internal evaluations for responsibility\ngovernance decision making. They are conducted separately from the model\ndevelopment team, to inform decision making about release. High level findings\nare fed back to the model team, but prompt sets are held-out to prevent\noverfitting and preserve the results' ability to inform decision making. Notable\nassurance evaluation results are reported to our Responsibility & Safety Council\nas part of release review.\n\n### Evaluation Results\n\nFor all areas of safety testing, we saw safe levels of performance across the\ncategories of child safety, content safety, and representational harms relative\nto previous Gemma models. All testing was conducted without safety filters to\nevaluate the model capabilities and behaviors. For text-to-text,  image-to-text,\nand audio-to-text, and across all model sizes, the model produced minimal policy\nviolations, and showed significant improvements over previous Gemma models'\nperformance with respect to high severity violations. A limitation of our\nevaluations was they included primarily English language prompts.\n\n## Usage and Limitations\n\nThese models have certain limitations that users should be aware of.\n\n### Intended Usage\n\nOpen generative models have a wide range of applications across various\nindustries and domains. The following list of potential uses is not\ncomprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information\nabout the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model\ntraining and development.\n\n-   Content Creation and Communication\n    -   **Text Generation**: Generate creative text formats such as\n        poems, scripts, code, marketing copy, and email drafts.\n    -   **Chatbots and Conversational AI**: Power conversational\n        interfaces for customer service, virtual assistants, or interactive\n        applications.\n    -   **Text Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of a text\n        corpus, research papers, or reports.\n    -   **Image Data Extraction**: Extract, interpret, and summarize\n        visual data for text communications.\n    -   **Audio Data Extraction**: Transcribe spoken language, translate speech\n        to text in other languages, and analyze sound-based data.\n-   Research and Education\n    -   **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative model\n        Research**: These models can serve as a foundation for researchers to\n        experiment with generative models and NLP techniques, develop\n        algorithms, and contribute to the advancement of the field.\n    -   **Language Learning Tools**: Support interactive language\n        learning experiences, aiding in grammar correction or providing writing\n        practice.\n    -   **Knowledge Exploration**: Assist researchers in exploring large\n        bodies of data by generating summaries or answering questions about\n        specific topics.\n\n### Limitations\n\n-   Training Data\n    -   The quality and diversity of the training data significantly\n        influence the model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data\n        can lead to limitations in the model's responses.\n    -   The scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas\n        the model can handle effectively.\n-   Context and Task Complexity\n    -   Models are better at tasks that can be framed with clear\n        prompts and instructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be\n        challenging.\n    -   A model's performance can be influenced by the amount of context\n        provided (longer context generally leads to better outputs, up to a\n        certain point).\n-   Language Ambiguity and Nuance\n    -   Natural language is inherently complex. Models might struggle\n        to grasp subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.\n-   Factual Accuracy\n    -   Models generate responses based on information they learned\n        from their training datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They\n        may generate incorrect or outdated factual statements.\n-   Common Sense\n    -   Models rely on statistical patterns in language. They might\n        lack the ability to apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.\n\n### Ethical Considerations and Risks\n\nThe development of generative models raises several ethical concerns. In\ncreating an open model, we have carefully considered the following:\n\n-   Bias and Fairness\n    -   Generative models trained on large-scale, real-world text and image data\n        can reflect socio-cultural biases embedded in the training material.\n        These models underwent careful scrutiny, input data pre-processing\n        described and posterior evaluations reported in this card.\n-   Misinformation and Misuse\n    -   Generative models can be misused to generate text that is\n        false, misleading, or harmful.\n    -   Guidelines are provided for responsible use with the model, see the\n        [Responsible Generative AI Toolkit](https://ai.google.dev/responsible).\n-   Transparency and Accountability:\n    -   This model card summarizes details on the models' architecture,\n        capabilities, limitations, and evaluation processes.\n    -   A responsibly developed open model offers the opportunity to\n        share innovation by making generative model technology accessible to\n        developers and researchers across the AI ecosystem.\n\nRisks identified and mitigations:\n\n-   **Perpetuation of biases**: It's encouraged to perform continuous monitoring\n    (using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of de-biasing\n    techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use cases.\n-   **Generation of harmful content**: Mechanisms and guidelines for content\n    safety are essential. Developers are encouraged to exercise caution and\n    implement appropriate content safety safeguards based on their specific\n    product policies and application use cases.\n-   **Misuse for malicious purposes**: Technical limitations and developer\n    and end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of\n    generative models. Educational resources and reporting mechanisms for users\n    to flag misuse are provided. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined\n    in the\n    [Gemma Prohibited Use Policy](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/prohibited_use_policy).\n-   **Privacy violations**: Models were trained on data filtered for removal of\n    certain personal information and other sensitive data. Developers are\n    encouraged to adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving\n    techniques.\n\n### Benefits\n\nAt the time of release, this family of models provides high-performance open\ngenerative model implementations designed from the ground up for responsible AI\ndevelopment compared to similarly sized models.\n\nUsing the benchmark evaluation metrics described in this document, these models\nhave shown to provide superior performance to other, comparably-sized open model\nalternatives.",

      "description": "# Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-int4-ov\n* Model creator: [Mistral AI](https://huggingface.co/mistralai)\n * Original model: [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)\n\n## Description\n\nThis is [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) model converted to the [OpenVINO™ IR](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/documentation/openvino-ir-format.html) (Intermediate Representation) format.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThe provided OpenVINO™ IR model is compatible with:\n\n* OpenVINO version 2024.2.0 and higher\n* Optimum Intel 1.19.0 and higher\n\n## Running Model Inference with [Optimum Intel](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index)\n\n\n1. Install packages required for using [Optimum Intel](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index) integration with the OpenVINO backend:\n\n```\npip install optimum[openvino]\n```\n\n2. Run model inference:\n\n```\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\nfrom optimum.intel.openvino import OVModelForCausalLM\n\nmodel_id = \"OpenVINO/<model_name>\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = OVModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)\n\ninputs = tokenizer(\"What is OpenVINO?\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=200)\ntext = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0]\nprint(text)\n```\n\nFor more examples and possible optimizations, refer to the [OpenVINO Large Language Model Inference Guide](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/learn-openvino/llm_inference_guide.html).\n\n## Running Model Inference with [OpenVINO GenAI](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai)\n\n1. Install packages required for using OpenVINO GenAI.\n```\npip install openvino-genai huggingface_hub\n```\n\n2. Download model from HuggingFace Hub\n   \n```\nimport huggingface_hub as hf_hub\n\nmodel_id = \"OpenVINO/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-int4-ov\"\nmodel_path = \"Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-int4-ov\"\n\nhf_hub.snapshot_download(model_id, local_dir=model_path)\n\n```\n\n3. Run model inference:\n\n```\nimport openvino_genai as ov_genai\n\ndevice = \"CPU\"\npipe = ov_genai.LLMPipeline(model_path, device)\nprint(pipe.generate(\"What is OpenVINO?\", max_length=200))\n```\n\nMore GenAI usage examples can be found in OpenVINO GenAI library [docs](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/blob/master/src/README.md) and [samples](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai?tab=readme-ov-file#openvino-genai-samples)\n\n## Limitations\n\nCheck the original model card for [limitations](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2#limitations).\n\n## Legal information\n\nThe original model is distributed under [apache-2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) license.
