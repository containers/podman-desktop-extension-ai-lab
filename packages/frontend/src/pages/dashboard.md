# Welcome to AI Studio

The Podman Desktop AI Studio extension simplifies getting started and develop with AI in a local environment. It provides key open-source technologies to start building on AI. A curated catalog of so-called recipes helps navigate the jungle of AI use cases and AI models. AI Studio further ships playgrounds: environments to experiment with and test AI models, for instance, a chat bot.

## Recipes Catalog

AI Studio ships with a so-called Recipes Catalog that helps you navigate a number of core AI use cases and problem domains such as Chat Bots, Code Generators and Text Summarizers. Each recipe comes with detailed explanations and sample applications that can be run with various large language models (LLMs). Experimenting with multiple models allows finding the optimal one for your use case.

## AI Models

AI Studio provides a curated list of open source AI models and LLMs. Once downloaded, the models are available to be used for AI applications, model services and playgrounds.

## Model serving

Once a model has been downloaded, users can start an inference server for the model. This allow to test the model using a playground environment or to connect applications as the inference server is exposing a well know chat API.

## Playgrounds

The integrated Playground environments allow for experimenting with available models in a local environment. An intuitive user prompt helps in exploring the capabilities and accuracy of various models and aids in finding the best model for the use case at hand.
